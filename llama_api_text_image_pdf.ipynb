              "\"0361-0128/10/3864/43-26 43Introduction\\nTHE GENETIC link between porphyry copper deposits and\\nmagmatic-hydrothermal processes is well established, based\\non mapping and petrological studies (Gustafson and Hunt,\\n1975; Dilles and Einaudi, 1992; Proffett, 2003), characteris-\\ntics of fluid inclusions (Roedder, 1971; Nash, 1976; Eastoe,\\n1978; Bodnar, 1995; Heinrich el al., 1999; Ulrich et al., 1999,\\n2002; Audetat et al., 2008), light stable isotopes (Sheppard et\\nal., 1969, 1971; Harris et al., 2005), and analogy with active\\nvolcanic fumaroles and geothermal systems (Henley and Mc-\\nNabb, 1978; Hedenquist and Lowenstern, 1994; Einaudi et\\nal., 2003). Formation of porphyry copper deposits requires\\nthe escape of magma and hydrothermal fluid from a magma\\nchamber located well below the deposit (Proffett, 2009), and\\nprecipitation of sulfides in structurally focused zones as a con-sequence of cooling, interaction with wall rocks, boiling,\\nand/or mixing with meteoric waters (Gustafson and Hunt,\\n1975; Brimhall, 1979; Reynolds and Beane, 1985; Hemley\\nand Hunt, 1992; Inan and Einaudi, 2002; Harris et al., 2005;\\nGruen et al., 2010; Landtwing et al., 2010). \\nHistorically, papers on Bingham have shown copper and\\ngold grade boundaries that encompass all porphyry intru-\\nsions, and the timing of sulfide deposition relative to the in-\\ntrusive sequence and different vein types has not been re-\\nsolved (James et al., 1961; John, E.C., 1978; Phillips et al.,\\n1998). Of the world’s porphyry copper deposits, Bingham\\nranks seventh based on contained copper metal (28 Mt), sec-\\nond based on con-\\ntained gold (1,600 t),\\nand fifth based on\\ncopper grade (Cooke\\net al., 2005). There-\\nfore, extending our\\nunderstanding ofThe Bingham Canyon Porphyry Cu-Mo-Au Deposit. \\nI. Sequence of Intrusions, Vein Formation, and Sulfide Deposition\\nPATRICK B. R EDMOND†,* AND MARCO T. E INAUDI\\nDepartment of Geological and Environmental Sciences, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305 USA\\nAbstract\\nThe Bingham Canyon porphyry copper-gold-molybdenum deposit is one of the largest and highest-grade\\nporphyry orebodies in the world. This study focused on the northwest side of the deposit where quartz mon-\\nzonite porphyry (QMP), the first and largest porphyry intrusion, hosts the bulk of the high-grade copper-gold\\nore (>1.0% Cu, >1.0 ppm Au). The north-northeast–trending, high-grade zone had pre-mining dimensions of\\n1,500 m strike, >300 m vertical, and 500 m width and contained more than 500 million tonnes (Mt) of ore\\n associated with potassic alteration and abundant quartz veins. The lack of superimposed sericitic alteration\\nyielded ideal exposures in which to study the early, high-temperature stages of ore formation, a style of miner-\\nalization that in many porphyry deposits represents the major period of copper introduction.\\nWe mapped multiple porphyry dikes in the sequence: (1) QMP , (2) latite porphyry (LP), (3) biotite porphyry\\n(BP), (4) quartz latite porphyry breccia (QLPbx), and (5) quartz latite porphyry (QLP). Porphyry dikes, faults,\\nand quartz veins are steeply dipping and have two dominant orientations; north-northeast– and northwest-\\nstriking. Dikes have a north-northeast strike but they thicken and develop northwest-trending apophyses and\\nhost high-grade copper-gold zones at intersections with northwest-faults, indicating that magmatic-hydrother-\\nmal fluids were focused by these structural intersections.\\nEach porphyry intrusion was accompanied by a similar sequence of veins, potassic alteration, and sulfides.\\nBiotite veinlets were followed by fractures with early dark micaceous (EDM) halos of sericite, K-feldspar,\\n biotite, andalusite, and local corundum containing disseminated bornite-chalcopyrite-gold. EDM halos are cut\\nby multiple generations of A-quartz veins representing the main Cu-Au ore-forming event. Postdating all\\n intrusions are quartz-molybdenite veins followed by quartz-sericite-pyrite veins.\\nCathodoluminescence (CL) petrography identified distinct A-quartz veinlets consisting of dark-luminescing\\nquartz filling fractures and dissolution vugs in earlier A-quartz veins and adjacent porphyry wall rock. These\\nveinlets contain abundant bornite and chalcopyrite and minor K-feldspar and are closely linked in time to the\\nintroduction of the bulk of the copper and gold. Although a similar sequence of veins was repeated on\\n emplacement of all porphyry intrusions, the vein density and intensity of potassic alteration declined with time.\\nThe youngest porphyry, QLP , is mostly weakly mineralized and locally unaltered. These observations indicate\\nthat magmatic-hydrothermal fluids underwent a similar physiochemical evolution during and immediately fol-\\nlowing emplacement of each of several porphyry dikes. The relationship between EDM veins and A-quartz\\nveins requires that the flux of magmatic fluid from the magma chamber occurred in an episodic manner as\\n opposed to a continuous discharge. \\nVein truncation relationships coupled with abrupt changes in copper-gold grades, sulfide ratios, and potas-\\nsic alteration intensity at porphyry intrusive contacts indicate that the mass of introduced copper and gold\\n decreased significantly during successive porphyry intrusive-hydrothermal cycles, presumably due to depletion\\nof metals and volatiles in the underlying magma chamber. \\n† Corresponding author: e-mail patrick.redmond@teck.com \\n*Present address: Teck Ireland Ltd., 5 Wentworth Place, Wicklow, County\\nWicklow, Ireland.©2010 Society of Economic Geologists, Inc.\\nEconomic Geology,  v. 105, pp. 43–68\\nSubmitted: June 16, 2009\\nAccepted: December 15, 2009Acronyms Used in this Paper\\nEDM = early dark micaceous\\nLP = latite porphyry\\nQLP = quartz latite porphyry\\nQLPbx = quartz latite porphyry breccia\\nQMP = quartz monzonite porphyry\\nBingham is important to developing theories regarding the\\nformation of giant, high-grade porphyry deposits.\\nOur study focuses on the high-grade zone of >1 percent\\ncopper and >1 ppm gold along the axis of porphyry intrusions.\\nWe examine the link between grades of copper and gold rel-\\native to district structure, vein types, and alteration in the\\ncontext of time lines established by mapping crosscutting re-\\nlations between multiple porphyry intrusions. Mapping pro-\\nvides compelling evidence that a regional structural grain of\\nextensional origin was the first-order control on dike em-\\nplacement, quartz vein attitudes, and ore trends. Each por-\\nphyry intrusion was accompanied by a similar sequence, but\\nat declining intensity, of veins, potassic alteration, and copper-\\ngold mineralization. We document the presence of early,\\nhigh-temperature veins, similar to the early dark micaceous\\n(EDM) veins of Butte, Montana (Meyer, 1965), that repre-\\nsent the first, although minor, introduction of copper and gold\\nat temperatures of 500ºC. We suggest that these veins indi-\\ncate a magmatic source region at 3.0 km below the present pit\\nbottom at paleodepths of about 5 km.Methods\\nWe mapped approx. 3,000 m of bench face in the QMP-LP\\nzone (Fig. 1) at a scale of 1:600, with emphasis on intrusive\\ncontacts between porphyries, age of veins relative to each\\nother and to porphyries, and changes in vein abundance, sul-\\nfide ratios, and alteration style across porphyry contacts. In\\norder to document the grade of individual porphyry dikes and\\nchanges in grade across intrusive contacts, we augmented\\nmine blast hole and diamond drill hole assays with assays\\nfrom 74 representative chip samples (0.5–6 kg in size) from\\ndifferent porphyry intrusions (see App. 1 for assay data and\\nsample location map).\\nTwo thousand meters of diamond drill core was logged at\\nscales of 1:240 and 1:600, using the same approach used for\\nmapping. Approx. 200 sawed samples were examined using a\\nbinocular microscope. Seventy-five polished thin sections\\nwere studied by standard transmitted and reflected light mi-\\ncroscopy and 30 of these were examined using an SEM and\\nCL detector.44 REDMOND AND EINAUDI\\n0361-0128/98/000/000-00 $6.00 44qmp\\nQuartz latite \\nporphyry (QLP)\\nEquigranular \\nmonzoniteSiltstone &\\nLimestone\\nSkarn &\\nLimestoneQuartzite\\nQuartz monzonite \\nporphyry (QMP)Latite porphyry (LP)\\nBiotite porphyry (BP)Quartz latite porphyry \\nbreccia (QLPbx)Fault with dip symbol\\nFold axis,with plunge,\\nanticline, syncline\\n55 Strike and dip of beds,\\ninclined, overturned7055352575\\n2040\\n70>1 ppm Au\\nQMP\\nMonzoniteO112 10’\\nO40 31'> 0.35 wt. u % C2032\\n5555352575\\n2040\\n70\\n8550\\n8050\\n6565\\n80806085Giant Chief Fault\\nMain HillFaultApex Fold\\n Copper\\nCenter FaultArea shown in Figure 3A\\nA’BinghamX\\nUTAH 500m\\nN\\nFIG. 1.

The Bingham stock is one\\nof a series of ore-related granitoid intrusions emplaced along\\nthe east-west –trending Uinta Arch during a period of north-\\nwest-southeast–directed extension in the mid-Tertiary (Butler\\net al., 1920; James et al., 1961; Roberts et al., 1965; Zeitz et\\nal., 1969; Tooker, 1971; Stewart et al., 1977; Constenius, 1996;\\nVogel et al., 1997; John, 1998; Presnell, 1998). The Oquirrh\\nMountains lie on the eastern edge of the Basin and Range\\nprovince and were tilted eastward during extensional faulting\\nduring mid-late Cenozoic time. Estimates of the degree of\\npostore tilting range from 10° to 25° (Atkinson and Einaudi,\\n1978; Lanier et al., 1978a; Melker and Geissman, 1998).\\nThe Bingham stock\\nThe Bingham stock is made up of an equigranular monzonite\\nphase that was intruded by a series of ore-related porphyrydikes. Previous studies have recognized three separate por-\\nphyries: quartz monzonite porphyry (QMP), latite porphyry\\n(LP), and quartz latite porphyry (QLP) (Stringham, 1953;\\nBray, 1969; Moore, 1970; Moore and Czamanske, 1973;\\nLanier et al., 1978a; Babcock et al., 1995; Phillips et al., 1998),\\nalthough a minette dike is shown on unpublished mine maps\\nby B.F. Stringham (ca. 1950) and is described by Deino and\\nKeith (1998) and Waite et al. (1998). Analysis of zircon yielded\\nU-Pb isotopic ages for monzonite of 38.55 ± 0.19 Ma (Parry\\net al., 2001) and 40Ar/39Ar isotopic ages of hydrothermal bi-\\notite in porphyry dikes yield ages ranging from 37.74 ± 0.11\\nto 37.07 ± 0.21 Ma (Deino and Keith, 1998; Parry et al.,\\n2001). These data suggest that ore-related hydrothermal al-\\nteration, associated with the emplacement of the porphyry\\ndikes, began about 0.75 m.y. after emplacement of the mon-\\nzonite. Our mapping led to the identification of two previ-\\nously unrecognized porphyry intrusions: biotite porphyry (BP)\\nand quartz latite porphyry breccia (QLPbx). The complete se-\\nquence of porphyries (from oldest to youngest) is (1) QMP ,\\n(2) LP , (3) BP , (4) QLPbx, and (5) QLP (Fig. 3, Table 1). \\nQuartz monzonite porphyry: QMP is the earliest and volu-\\nmetrically largest porphyry intrusion and contains the highest\\ncopper and gold grades in porphyry-hosted ore.

QMP contains 50 to 60 vol percent\\nphenocrysts of plagioclase, orthoclase, hornblende, biotite,\\nand rare quartz eyes (Table 1). Unaltered groundmass is\\naplitic (50–100 µm) and composed primarily of subequal\\namounts of quartz and orthoclase.\\nLatite porphyry: LP (Bray, 1969; Moore, 1970; Lanier et\\nal., 1978b) occurs as a series of north-northeast–striking dikes\\nand sills that extend for over 3 km along the northwest mar-\\ngin of the Bingham stock (Fig. 1). LP dikes within the QMP-\\nLP zone are 10 to 80 m wide and dip at 60°–75° NW (Fig. 3).\\nLP and QMP are similar in terms of phenocryst and ground-\\nmass composition (Table 1). Contacts between the two por-\\nphyries are sharp (Fig. 4A), with no chilled margins on LP .\\nBiotite porphyry: BP cuts both QMP and LP and is in turn\\ntruncated by, and occurs as xenoliths within, QLPbx (Fig.\\n4D). The dike is much darker in color than the other four por-\\nphyries owing to the presence of abundant phenocrystic and\\ngroundmass biotite (see App. 2 for whole-rock XRF analyses).\\nPit mapping suggests that BP is continuous for 500 m along\\nits north-northeast strike in the QMP-LP zone, ranges from\\n2.5 to 4 m wide, and dips 60°–65° NW (Fig. 3). BP contains\\nsignificantly more biotite phenocrysts (12–15%) than the\\nother four porphyries (2–4%, Table 1). K-feldspar and plagio-\\nclase phenocrysts are locally rounded or embayed, likely the\\nresult of resorption during emplacement. BP contains small,\\n<5 cm diameter, angular fragments of both QMP and LP . BP\\nis potassically altered and mineralized throughout the study\\narea and locally contains high-grade copper-gold ore and A-\\nquartz veins (e.g., BP sample 5090-1500 assayed 3.5% Cu and\\n7.1 ppm Au, App. 1). Vein truncation relationships and an\\nabrupt decrease in copper-gold grades at contacts with later\\nporphyries indicate the the high grades in BP are not the re-\\nsult of overprinting by magmatic-hydrothermal fluids from a\\nyounger porphyry intrusion.\\nQuartz latite porphyry breccia: QLPbx cuts QMP , LP , and\\nBP and is in turn cut by QLP that locally displays a <1-cm-widechilled margin (Fig. 4C). QLPbx is the only porphyry intru-\\nsion that contains abundant wall-rock xenoliths. Xenoliths\\nrange in size from <1 to 10 cm width, are angular to sub-\\nrounded, and make up 20 to 50 vol percent of the rock.\\nQLPbx bodies have extremely irregular margins, character-\\nized by abundant 5- to 50-cm-wide dikelets extending several\\nmeters into adjacent wall rocks and commonly forming\\ncrackle breccia textures. The most extensive exposures of\\nQLPbx were on the 4890 bench, where a 10- to 20-m-wide\\nbody extended for 150 m along the north-northeast–striking\\ncontact between LP and QMP (Fig. 3). Fragments of QMP\\nand of LP within QLPbx contain multiple generations of trun-\\ncated A-quartz veins with bornite-chalcopyrite, indicating\\nthat QLPbx was emplaced after quartz vein formation and\\nsulfide deposition in LP . In addition, QLPbx contains frag-\\nments of BP where it truncates this post-LP dike (Fig. 4D). \\nQLPbx contains approx. 11 to 17 vol percent phenocrysts of\\nplagioclase and K-feldspar and lesser book biotite, biotitized\\nhornblende, and rare quartz eyes (Table 1). Groundmass is\\ncomposed of aplitic-textured K-feldspar, quartz, and biotite.\\nUnlike the other four porphyries, the groundmass of QLPbx\\ncontains numerous irregular (0.2–1mm) vesicles that make up\\n2 to 5 vol percent of the groundmass. With the exception of\\nrare grains of fine-grained biotite, these vesicles are unfilled.\\nQuartz latite porphyry: QLP dikes, first described by\\nStringham (1953), crop out in the pit for over 3 km (Fig. 1).\\nWilson (1978) describes an unusual vesicular QLP plug that\\ncontained coarse-grained chalcopyrite in quartz-lined vesicles\\nbut no vesicular QLP was observed during the current study.\\nWithin the mapped area the most continous QLP dike ranges\\nfrom <10 to 50 m in width and dip 70° to 85° NW. Northwest-\\nstriking dikelets and bulbous apophyses of QLP are found\\nwhere major northwest-striking faults in monzonite project\\ninto the north-northeast–striking QMP-LP zone (Fig. 3). Bi-\\notitized QLP is medium brown in color and contains about 30\\n40 vol percent phenocrysts, including 3 to 7 percent quartz\\neyes (Table 1).

QLP concludes the trend toward increasing abun-\\ndance of groundmass through the succession of porphyry in-\\ntrusions (Table 1).\\nStructural control of porphyry dikes\\nThe dominant faults in the district are steeply dipping,\\nnorth-northeast–striking faults of probable Mesozoic age re-\\nactivated as normal faults during early Basin and Range ex-\\ntension (Farmin, 1933; Tooker, 1971; Atkinson and Einaudi,\\n1978). These north-northeast faults served as conduits for\\nore-forming fluids peripheral to the Bingham stock, including\\nvein and replacement Pb-Zn-Ag ores in the US (Rubright and\\nHart, 1968) and Highland Boy mines (Atkinson and Einaudi,\\n1978). The most continuous of the north-northeast faults\\nmapped in the open pit, the Main Hill fault zone (Fig. 1), was\\nexpressed by pre-mine topography as a deeply incised tribu-\\ntary to Bingham Canyon known as Carr fork (figs. 2, 3 in\\nJames, 1978). This fault projects into the main porphyry dike\\nswarm and it is likely that the porphyry dike complex was em-\\nplaced along this fault zone.\\nIn addition to the dominant north-northeast faults, a set of\\nnorthwest-striking faults dipping 50°–85° SW are a secondary\\ncontrol on dike emplacement. The most continuous north-\\nwest faults in the open pit are the Giant Chief (Smith, 1975)\\nand Copper Center faults (Fig. 1). Again, pre-mine topogra-\\nphy reflects the Giant Chief-Copper Canyon fault zone in the\\nsoutheast trend of upper Bingham Canyon (figs. 2, 3 in James,\\n1978).\\nJames et al. (1961) suggested that the zone of intersection\\nof north-northeast and northwest faults was a fundamental\\ncontrol on localizing the Bingham stock at the district scale.\\nAt the mine scale, porphyry dikes may have intruded the\\nnorth-northeast faults. This study demonstrates that locally\\nLP and QLP formed thickened nodes and northwest-striking\\napophyses at intersections of northwest and north-northeast\\nfaults. More importantly, below we present evidence that\\nzones of high quartz vein abundance and high-grade copper-\\ngold ore (defined here as >1% Cu and >1 ppm Au) within the\\nQMP-LP zone are localized at intersections of north-north-\\neast and northwest faults and that the strikes of quartz veinsreflect the north-northeast and northwest structural grain of\\nthe district.\\nVeins, Wall-Rock Alteration, and Sulfide Mineralization\\nBased on our mapping, we have identified a sequence of\\nveins that formed after the intrusion of each porphyry, and,\\ntherefore, in a cyclical sequence repeated at least four times\\n(EDM veins were not recorded in BP). A single sequence\\nconsists, from early to late (Table 2), of (1) biotite veinlets, (2)\\nEDM veins, and (3) A-quartz veins, all intimately associated\\nwith potassic alteration. Postdating all intrusions are (4)\\nquartz-molybdenite veins, and (5) minor, youngest quartz-\\nsericite-pyrite veins.\\nBiotite veinlets\\nWispy biotite veinlets are the earliest vein type at Bingham\\n(Phillips et al., 1998), occurring in low abundance in all five\\nporphyries. Our mapping typically found 5 to 10 veinlets per\\n10 m of drill core or bench face. Biotite veinlets are typically\\na few centimeters long, 0.5 to 1.0 mm wide, and are com-\\nposed of medium-brown biotite with no magnetite. Biotite\\nveinlets contain Cu-Fe sulfides only in cases where they are\\nadjacent to younger veins that contain abundant Cu-Fe sul-\\nfides. We interpret this textural relationship to indicate that\\nCu-Fe sulfides were not deposited contemporaneously with\\nbiotite veinlets, but were a later addition. \\nEarly dark micaceous veins \\nEDM veins, following the terminology of Meyer (1965), are\\ncharacterized by unfilled fractures with alteration halos in\\nwhich plagioclase phenocrysts are replaced by andalusite\\n(10–15%), biotite (15–20%), sericite (30–40%), and K-\\nfeldspar (25–45%) (Figs. 4, 5). Trace corundum (<1%) is not\\nin contact with rare quartz. EDM halos are 5 to 40 mm wide\\nand are continuous over several meters. Andalusite and bi-\\notite are locally replaced by sericite, which is in turn replaced\\nby K-feldspar, a reaction sequence recognized in EDM veins\\nat Butte, Montana (Meyer, 1965; Brimhall, 1977). K-feldspar\\npartially to completely replaces plagioclase phenocrysts in\\nhigh-grade samples that also contain younger A-quartz veins\\nwith K-feldspar halos.

Within each porphyry, EDM veins are cut\\nand offset by multiple generations of A-quartz veins (Fig. 5A).\\nEDM vein abundance is constant within and immediately\\nbelow the high-grade copper-gold orebody in QMP . Based on\\nlogging of drill core in the QMP-LP zone, EDM veins are\\npresent from 1,150 m elevation (i.e., 350 m below the base of\\nthe high-grade ore) up through the shallowest drill core in-\\ntersections examined (~1,700 m elev). Therefore, the mini-\\nmum vertical extent of EDM veins is approx. 550 m. \\nA-quartz veins\\nA-quartz veins, as defined by Gustafson and Hunt (1975),\\nare the most abundant vein type in the porphyry orebody (Fig\\n5A); in QMP they locally exceed 25 vol percent of the rock.\\nMost are 0.5 to 2 cm wide, but some are up to 15 cm wide.\\nOur mapping in the QMP-LP zone shows that the majority of\\nA-veins occur in two dominant sets: north-northeast– and\\nnorthwest-striking (Figs. 6, 7). A-veins contain digentite, bor-\\nnite, chalcopyrite, and rare molybdenite. Digenite forms mu-\\ntual boundaries, lamellae, or grating textures in bornite, but isnot in contact with chalcopyrite. Gold grades correlate strongly\\nwith copper grades (Fig. 8) and with zones rich in digenite-\\nbornite. Gold occurs predominantly as high-fineness grains 5\\nto 20 m in diameter (Redmond, 2002).\\nA-quartz veins occur in all five porphyries, but they are\\nmost abundant in QMP , in which four subtypes are recog-\\nnized megascopically on the basis of structure, texture, and\\ncrosscutting relations. These four subtypes are termed A1 to\\nA4 in relative age sequence, with A1 the oldest (Table 2). The\\nsequence A1 to A4, well-defined in QMP , but less so in the\\nyounger porphyries, displays a temporal progression from ir-\\nregular wavy to straight-walled. A1 veins are the most irregu-\\nlar and discontinuous, pinching and swelling along their\\nlength (Fig. 5C, D). A2 veins commonly occur in sheeted sets\\nand are sinuous and curved (Fig. 5E, F). A3 veins typically\\ncontain thin growth zones of hydrothermal K-feldspar that\\nare subparallel to the vein walls, giving these veins a banded\\nappearance (Fig. 5C, D), similar to the “banding of K-spar”\\ndescribed in some A-quartz veins at El Salvador (Gustafson\\nand Hunt, 1975, p. 882). A4 veins are the most abundant and\\nhave relatively straight walls but do not have an obvious cen-\\nter line (Fig. 5C, D).

We refer to\\nthis quartz as Q1 quartz (Fig. 7). \\nA5 quartz-sulfide veinlets, the dominant ore hosts, are only\\nvisible using CL microscopy. They consist of fine-grained\\n(0.01–0.1 mm) dark-luminescing quartz, referred to as Q2\\nquartz. CL petrography shows that A5 veinlets are typically\\n0.01 to 0.1 mm wide and range from millimeters to a few cen-\\ntimeters in length. Within the QMP-hosted orebody, all A1 to\\nA4 veins and immediately adjacent porphyry wall rock are cut\\nby numerous A5 veinlets and irregular vugs filled with Q2\\nquartz, and varying amounts of copper-iron sulfides anddark-luminescing K-feldspar (Fig. 7). Vug margins truncate\\ngrowth zones in Q1 quartz grains, indicating that vug forma-\\ntion involved quartz dissolution. A5 veinlets and vugs cutting\\nearlier A-veins occur in all five porphyry intrusions (Fig. 7).\\nThese are the youngest veinlets in any given intrusion-miner-\\nalization event, host the majority of Cu-Fe sulfides, and are\\ntherefore the most closely linked in time to the deposition of\\n copper and gold. Fluid inclusions in Q2 quartz show that cop-\\nper-iron sulfides in A5 veinlets were precipitated at tempera-\\ntures of 425° to 350°C (Redmond, 2002; Redmond et al.,\\n2004; Landtwing et al., 2005, 2010). Fluid inclusion data also\\nshow that lithostatic to hydrostatic decompression occurring\\nduring A-quartz vein formation as temperatures declined to\\naround 425°C (Redmond, 2002).\\nA5 veinlets and vugs also occur within wall rock adjacent to\\nA1 to A4 veins but are less continuous, more irregular, and\\ncontain more K-feldspar than A5 veinlets cutting A1 to A4\\nveins. A5 veinlets commonly contain K-feldspar as a veinlet-\\nfilling mineral where they cut alkali feldspar phenocrysts and\\nquartz where they cut quartz grains (Redmond et al., 2004;\\nfig. 1.10). These textures suggest that the vein-forming fluids\\nwere close to saturation with quartz and K-feldspar and that\\nwall-rock minerals acted as seed crystals. \\nWhereas thicker A5 veinlets commonly extend across con-\\ntacts between A1to A4 veins and wall rock, thinner A5 vein-\\nlets in A1 to A4 veins tend to terminate at vein margins. These\\ntextures suggest that rheological differences focused A5 frac-\\nturing in earlier A1 to A4 quartz veins rather than in wall rock,\\nwhich resulted in the correlation between higher copper-gold\\ngrades and abundance of A1 to A4 veins within (but not\\nbelow) the QMP orebody.\\nIntense quartz-K-feldspar alteration\\nPotassic alteration styles range from weak (biotitization of\\nhornblende with porphyry texture preserved) to strong (gran-\\nular, vuggy quartz and K-feldspar with porphyry texture oblit-\\nerated) (Table 3). Within the high-grade QMP-LP zone, the\\noverall intensity of potassic alteration is a function of A-quartz\\nvein abundance. \\nZones of intense quartz-K-feldspar alteration are found\\nwhere A-quartz veins constitute ≥10 vol percent of the rock\\nand alteration halos overlap. Such alteration occurs locally in\\nLP , QLPbx, and QLP , but zones up to 10 m across were ob-\\nserved only in the high-grade copper-gold zone in QMP where\\ngrades commonly exceed 2.0 percent copper and 4 ppm\\ngold. In bench faces, these zones are visually striking, with\\nabundant vitreous A-quartz veins and grayish-white wall\\nrock composed of a granular (0.2–1.0 mm) intergrowth of\\nquartz and K-feldspar grains, 1- to 3-mm orange-brown bi-\\notite flakes, and gaudy millimeter-sized bornite-digenite\\nand chalcopyrite grains (Fig. 5G). Irregular blocky A1\\nquartz veins, commonly with brecciated textures, are par-\\nticularly abundant within these zones. CL petrography\\nshows that entire thin sections (veins and porphyry wall\\nrock) contain a closely spaced network of A5 quartz veinlets\\nand vugs containing abundant copper-iron sulfides. In thin\\nsection, biotite flakes are replaced along their margins by\\nquartz, and early biotite veinlets and EDM veins are ab-\\nsent, having presumably been completely replaced by\\nquartz-K-feldspar.54 REDMOND AND EINAUDI\\n0361-0128/98/000/000-00 $6.00 540.02.04.06.08.010.012.0\\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 4.0\\nCopper (%)Gold (ppm)\\nQMP\\nLP\\nBP\\nQLPbx\\nQLP\\nMonzonite\\n0.002.004.006.008.0010.0012.00\\n0.00 0.50 1.00 1.50 2.00 2.50 3.00 3.50 4.00 4.50Au ppm\\nQMP\\nLP\\nBP\\nQLP\\nBornite/Chalcopyrite RatioA\\nB\\nFIG. 8.

B. Scatter plot showing a good correlation between gold\\ngrade and bornite/chalcopyrite ratio for 14 samples (of the 74 plotted on A).\\nThese small, well-constrained samples were collected in the open pit, and\\nrepresent four of the five porphyry intrusions. \\nQuartz-molybdenite veins\\nThe bulk of the molybdenite in the QMP-LP zone occurs\\nin quartz-molybdenite veins that cut and offset A-quartz veins\\nin all five porphyry intrusions. No truncated quartz-molybde-\\nnum veins were observed at porphyry contacts or within the\\nnumerous xenoliths of QMP , LP , and BP examined in expo-\\nsures of QLPbx. Thus, these veins postdate all intrusive activ-\\nity (Fig. 4G). Trace molybdenite occurs locally as isolated\\ngrains with copper-iron sulfides in some A-quartz veins and\\nmay or may not have been deposited at the same time as\\nquartz-molybdenum veins. \\nQuartz-molybdenite veins within the open pit, above 1,500\\nm elevation, are typically 5 to 50 mm wide and are composed\\nof 1 to 10 mm euhedral quartz crystals that are well zoned in\\nCL and have a well-developed vuggy centerline. They com-\\nmonly contain trace chalcopyrite. In contrast, quartz-molyb-\\ndenite veins from deep drill holes (A51 and A57 between 100\\nand 650 m elev) are 1 to 7 mm wide, contain fine-grained\\nquartz, no chalcopyrite, and are commonly wavy and lack a\\nwell-developed centerline (Fig. 5H). CL petrography clearly\\nshows that the bulk of the molybdenite in these veins was de-\\nposited on the walls of dissolution vugs. The remaining poros-\\nity in these vugs is filled by zeolite and/or calcite that are\\nprobably younger than the molybdenite (Redmond, 2002, fig.\\n1.28). Quartz-molybdenite veins at depth cut and offset bar-\\nren A-quartz veins (Fig. 5H) and also cut thin QLP dikes.\\nLate hydrolytic alteration \\nPyrite veins with quartz-sericite-pyrite halos (D-veins of\\nGustafson and Hunt, 1975) cut and offset quartz veins and\\nquartz-molybdenum veins (Fig. 4H). D-veins are extremely\\nrare in the QMP-LP zone; we mapped less than 50 D-veins in\\n3,000 m of bench face. The vein-filling material in these veins\\nwas dominated by pyrite (<95%) with local minor chalcopy-\\nrite and quartz. Veins were typically 5 mm wide with selvages\\nranging from 10 to 30 mm wide. However, on strike to the\\nnortheast and southwest and at higher elevations, D-veins are\\nmore abundant and vein selvages locally overlap to form >10\\nm wide zones of pervasive sericitic alteration (Lanier et al.,1978b; Babcock et al., 1995; Inan and Einaudi, 2002; Parry et\\nal., 2002). \\nMixtures of smectite, illite, ± kaolinite replace plagioclase\\nphenocrysts to varying degrees throughout the Bingham stock\\nbut this alteration is most common along north-northeast–\\nstriking faults and fractures (Atkinson and Einaudi, 1978;\\nLanier et al., 1978a). Illite-smectite alteration does not affect\\nK-feldspar and biotite (Fig. 4B–D, G). Within zones of in-\\ntense K-feldspar-quartz alteration, where plagioclase phe-\\nnocrysts were totally replaced by K-feldspar in earlier stages,\\nthis late argillic alteration is absent because of the lack of pla-\\ngioclase. Late argillic alteration does not appear to be related\\nto any vein type, is not accompanied by sulfides, and neither\\nalters the local bornite/chalcopyrite ratios nor the grade pat-\\nterns. \\nChanges in Mineralization Intensity across \\nPorphyry Contacts\\nWithin the QMP-LP zone, there is generally an abrupt de-\\ncrease in abundance of A-quartz veins, intensity of potassic al-\\nteration, bornite/chalcopyrite ratios and copper-gold grades\\nacross contacts from older to younger porphyries (Fig. 9). \\nQuartz vein abundance\\nMost A-quartz veins (> 90%) in QMP were truncated by\\nLP (Fig. 4A), indicating that the bulk of ore-forming hy-\\ndrothermal activity in QMP took place before the intrusion of\\nLP . However, a small percentage (<10%) of Cu-Fe sulfide-\\nbearing A-quartz veins cut the LP-QMP contact, indicating\\nthat some copper and gold were also introduced into QMP\\nafter emplacement of LP . BP , in turn, truncates most A-\\nquartz veins in LP . All exposures of QLPbx contain abundant\\nfragments of earlier porphyries with truncated A-veins (Fig.\\n4B). QLP in turn truncates most A-veins in QLPbx. Average\\nquartz vein abundance declines within each of the five suc-\\ncessive porphyries in the QMP-LP zone, as follows: QMP 5 to\\n15 percent (by volume), LP 1 to 5 percent , BP 1 to 5 percent,\\nQLPbx 1 to 2 percent, and QLP <1 percent (Fig. 9A).

All younger por-\\nphyry dikes have weak to moderate potassic alteration, al-\\nthough both LP and QLP (Fig. 5F) locally contain meter-\\nscale zones of moderate to intense potassic alteration. QLP\\ncontains areas, on the order of 10 to 30 m across, that are un-\\naltered except along rare A-quartz veins with selvages in\\nwhich hornblende phenocrysts are biotitized (Fig. 4F).\\nBornite/chalcopyrite ratios\\nThe bornite/chalcopyrite and bornite/digenite ratios of ore\\nin the QMP-LP zone vary considerably both within and be-\\ntween porphyry intrusions (Fig. 9C). The highest bornite/\\nchalcopyrite ratios (1:2–1:1) are found in QMP . In the central\\nportion of this zone (around drill hole D211) bornite/chal-\\ncopyrite ratios are greater than 1:1 and locally range up to\\n10:1. Digenite lamellae in bornite are observed in amounts\\nsubequal to bornite only within QMP . An abrupt decrease in\\nbornite/chalcopyrite ratio occurs across the contact from\\nQMP to LP (Fig. 9C); LP is generally chalcopyrite dominant.\\nExceptions are two narrow LP dikes logged in drill hole D211\\nand the high-grade (>1% copper) zone in LP around drill\\nhole D216 (Fig. 10) in which bornite is more abundant than\\nchalcopyrite. Chalcopyrite-only and composite chalcopyrite-\\nbornite grains constitute the bulk (>95%) of sulfides in LP;\\nbornite grains with grating-textured digenite are rare. Bor-\\nnite/chalcopyrite ratios in QLP are generally less than 1:2 (Fig\\n9C). These observations indicate that bornite/chalcopyrite ra-\\ntios, and therefore bulk Cu/Fe ratios of sulfides declined with\\ntime through the succession of intrusions. \\nCopper and gold grades\\nPublished grade maps of the Bingham pit (Phillips et al.,\\n1998, their fig. 4) show zones of >1.0, 0.7 to 1.0, and >0.35\\npercent copper, but grade contours are smoothed across por-\\nphyry contacts. In order to document copper and gold grades\\nthat reflect observed grade changes across dike contacts, we\\nhave interpreted assays from approx. 10-m-spaced blast holes,\\ndrill core, and our chip samples (see App. 1 for sample loca-\\ntions), based on mapped relations on pit benches and in drill\\ncore (Figs. 10, 11).56 REDMOND AND EINAUDI\\n0361-0128/98/000/000-00 $6.00 56Intense Moderate Weak Partly biotitizedPotassic alteration (intrusive rocks only)1500m1600mElevation\\n1400m\\n1300m1700m\\nD162D109 \\nD211D195 \\nD404 D114\\nD361C153 C116 C090\\n1999 pit surface\\nMonzoniteQMP\\nQLP\\nLP>0.7% CuA’ (SSE) (NNW)  A \\nNo dataNo data > 15 %Quartz vein abundance (volume percent)Zone of abundant\\nbarren A4 quartz\\nveins in QMP\\n10 - 15 % 5 - 10 % 1 - 5 % < 1 %1500m1600mElevation\\n1400m\\n1300m1700m\\nD162D109 \\nD211D195 \\nD404 D114\\nD361C153 C116C090\\n>0.7% Cu\\nMonzoniteQMP\\nQLP\\nLP\\n50mA’ (SSE) (NNW)  A \\nB1999 pit surface\\nA\\n>1.0Cp - (Py)Cp     Bn\\n0.5 - 1.0 <0.5Bornite/chalcopyrite ratio (vol. % bn/vol. % cp)Bn    Cp Bn      Cp\\nNo dataD162D109 \\nD211D195 \\nD404 D114\\nD361C153C116 C090\\n1500m1600mElevation\\n1400m\\n1300m1700m\\n1999 pit surfaceA’ (SSE) (NNW)  A \\nMonzoniteQMP\\nQLP\\nLP>0.7% Cu\\nCFIG. 9.

Map (A) and cross section (B) show-\\ning gold grades in QMP-LP zone. Data sources\\nthe same as Figure 10. Rock-type contacts are\\nshown as thin black lines.\\nWithin the QMP-LP zone, high-grade copper-gold ore oc-\\ncurs in all five porphyry intrusions and within the equigranu-\\nlar monzonite although the volumes contained in porphyries\\nthat postdate QMP are relatively small. The bulk of the high-\\ngrade copper-gold ore in the QMP-LP zone is hosted in QMP\\nand monzonite. The zone of >1.0 percent Cu in QMP (at the\\n1998–1999 pit surface) had dimensions of only 250 ×150 m\\nin plan view (Fig. 10). However, this exposure represented\\nthe remaining basal portion of a much larger volume of high-\\ngrade copper ore in QMP that may have extended up to the\\npre-mining surface, a vertical distance of greater than 500 m\\n(Fig. 10). This zone also contains extremely high gold grades,\\nparticularly around drill hole D211, which intersected over\\n100 m of >3 ppm gold. This high-grade ore occurs at the in-\\ntersection of the north-northeast porphyry trend (Main Hill\\nfault zone) and the projection of the northwest-striking Giant\\nChief fault (Fig. 1), and the majority of A-quartz veins in this\\nzone mimic these structural trends (Fig. 6). Both copper and\\ngold grades drop off sharply within QMP below approx. 1,500\\nm elevation, from >1 to <0.35 percent Cu, and from >1 to\\n<0.15 ppm Au over a vertical distance of 35 to 100 m (Figs. 9,\\n10). This abrupt decline in copper and gold grades at approx.\\n1,500 m elevation is observed along the entire strike length of\\nQMP and in equigranular monzonite at the southwest and\\nnortheast ends of QMP—a strike length of approx. 2 km. \\nWithin the mapped area, LP generally contains lower grades\\nof copper and gold than QMP and grades drop abruptly across\\nQMP-LP contacts (Figs. 10, 11). For example, across a con-\\ntact from QMP (sample 4990-1380, see App. 1) to LP (sam-\\nple 4990-1375, see App. 1) on bench 4990 we documented\\nthe following abrupt changes: copper grade declined from 2.5\\nto 0.7 percent, gold grade declined from 5.8 to 0.8 ppm, bor-\\nnite/chalcopyrite ratio declined from 5:1 to 1:7, A-quartz vein\\nabundance declined from 15 to 5 percent, and intensity of\\npotassic alteration declined from moderate-locally intense to\\nweakly developed. A similar drop in grade from 1.9 to 0.5 per-\\ncent copper and 5.6 to 1.0 ppm gold occurs across the QMP-\\nLP contact on bench 5190 (see App. 1). We collected repre-\\nsentative chip samples from QMP (n = 23) and LP (n = 25),\\nincluding samples from both sides of intrusive contacts (i.e.,\\n1–5 m apart). The average grade of QMP in these samples\\nwas 1.3 pecent Cu and 3.5 ppm Au compared to 0.6 percent\\nCu and 1.0 ppm Au in adjacent LP . However, LP locally con-\\ntains high-grade ore: drill hole D126 (Fig. 10) intersected 36\\nm of LP containing 1.08 percent copper at the intersection of\\nthe north-northeast porphyry trend and the northwest-strik-\\ning Copper Center fault, an intersection also marked by an in-\\ncrease in width of the LP dike. Copper-gold grades in LP\\ndrop sharply below 1,500 m elevation, as in QMP .\\nBP also contains high-grade mineralization with grades lo-\\ncally exceeding those in adjacent QMP and LP . For example,\\na 2-m-wide BP dike mapped on bench 5090 assayed 1.45 per-\\ncent copper and 3 ppm gold (sample 5090-710, see App. 1).\\nA representative sample of QMP (sample 5090-713, see App.\\n1) 3 m northeast of this contact assayed 0.57 percent copper\\nand 1.7 ppm gold. \\nAbundant mineralized fragments of earlier porphyry dikes\\ncommonly increase the overall grade of the QLPbx, but the\\ninherent grade of this intrusion is low. For example, QMP\\nxenoliths carefully sawn out of one QLPbx sample (Fig. 4B)contained 2.2 percent copper and 5.7 ppm gold (sample\\n5190-1910A, see App. 1) whereas the QLPbx matrix con-\\ntained only 0.2 percent copper and 0.4 ppm gold (sample\\n5190-1910B, see App. 1). However, QLPbx locally contains\\nsmall zones of high-grade copper mineralization—for exam-\\nple: at one location on bench 5090 the igneous matrix of\\nQLPbx was cut by a 2-m-wide zone of abundant 1- to 2-mm-\\nwide, A2 sheeted quartz veinlets with bornite and chalcopy-\\nrite and visually estimated grades of >1.5 percent copper.\\nThis high-grade zone in QLPbx is also located at the inter-\\nsection of the north-northeast porphyry trend and the north-\\nwest-striking Copper Center fault, suggesting that this struc-\\ntural intersection persisted as an upflow zone for mineralizing\\nfluids through successive porphyry intrusions.\\nCopper and gold grades in QLP are extremely variable but\\nthe dike is generally significantly lower in grade than adjacent\\nQMP or LP (Figs. 10, 11). The main northeast-trending por-\\ntion of QLP contains 0.15 to 0.35 percent copper and 0.15 to\\n0.3 ppm gold. However, the dike locally contains meter-scale\\nzones of high-grade mineralization. For example, on bench\\n5090, a 1- to 3-m-wide zone of abundant A-quartz veins and\\nassociated intense potassic alteration assayed 1.90 percent\\ncopper and 4.5 ppm gold (Fig. 5F, sample 5090-1700, see\\nApp. 1). This high-grade zone is located where the dike thick-\\nens and develops a northwest-trending apophysis that is on\\ntrend with the projection of the northwest-trending Giant\\nChief fault. Biotitized QLP at the distal ends of northwest-\\ntrending peripheral apophyses contain lower grades of copper\\n(<0.15%) and unbiotitized zones contain even less copper,\\ntypically less than 200 ppm.\\nThe above observations regarding copper-gold grades can\\nbe summarized as follows (Figs. 10, 11): (1) abrupt grade\\nchanges occur at porphyry contacts, (2) there is a general de-\\ncline through time in the average copper-gold grade of por-\\nphyry intrusions, (3) structural intersections between north-\\nnortheast–striking porphyry dikes and northwest-striking\\nfaults focused hydrothermal fluid flow and mark the location\\nof individual high-grade copper-gold zones in successive por-\\nphyry intrusions, and (4) an abrupt decline in copper-gold\\ngrades occurs below approx. 1,500 m elevation in all five por-\\nphyry intrusions along the entire strike length of the QMP-LP\\nzone. This abrupt decline in grade is limited to the northwest\\nside of the open pit; elsewhere, relatively high grade mineral-\\nization persists to greater depth, forming the deep peripheral\\nroots of the +0.35 percent Cu zone (Fig. 2). In these roots,\\ncopper grades gradually decrease with depth.\\nVeins and Alteration below the QMP-LP Zone\\nWe logged three drill holes (D109, D195, and D404) that\\npass through the base of the high-grade QMP-LP zone (Figs.\\n3, 10, 11) in order to document the changes in alteration and\\nvein types that accompany the abrupt decline in copper and\\ngold grades below 1,500 m elevation (Figs. 2, 10, 11). \\nEDM veins are equally abundant within and immediately\\nbelow the high-grade copper-gold orebody in QMP but were\\nnot observed at depths greater than 350 m below the base of\\nhigh grade (below ~1,150 m elev). EDM veins within this\\n350-m interval below the QMP-hosted orebody are cut by\\nbarren A-quartz veins and account for most of low-grade cop-\\nper (300–500 ppm) present in QMP at these deeper levels. THE BINGHAM CANYON PORPHYRY Cu-Mo-Au DEPOSIT: INTRUSIONS, VEIN FORMATION, & SULFIDE DEPOSITION 59\\n0361-0128/98/000/000-00 $6.00 59\\nBelow the base of the high-grade copper-gold orebody of\\nthe QMP-LP zone, the abundance of A1 to A4 quartz veins\\ndoes not change significantly, but the abundance of sulfide-\\nbearing A5 veinlets (observed in CL) and intensity of potassic\\nalteration decline abruptly (Redmond, 2002; figs. 1.17 and\\n1.18; Fig. 8). Dark luminescing Q2 quartz was observed in\\nsome deep samples from below the orebody (down to 1,090\\nm elev) but generally occurs as overgrowths on anhedral Q1\\nquartz grains and not in well-developed A5 veinlets. \\nA number of deep drill holes were completed in the 1970s\\nby The Anaconda Company and two of these drill holes, A51\\n(1471.2 m deep) and A57 (1942 m deep), intersected QMP\\nbetween 150 and 600 m elevation (Fig. 2), that is, over 1 km\\nbelow the QMP-hosted copper-gold orebody. QMP in these\\ndeep intersections is pervasively biotitized. Biotite veinlets\\nare the earliest vein type noted, and EDM veins were not ob-\\nserved. Barren A1 toA4 quartz veins are relatively abundant,\\ntypically 5 to10 vol percent, and similar to the typical abun-\\ndance of A1-A4 veins in the QMP Cu-Au orebody above\\n1,500 m elevation. QMP in these deep holes contains only\\nminor copper: 160 m of 142 ppm copper in hole A57, and 162\\nm of 155 ppm copper in hole A51. No gold or molybdenum\\nassays were carried out, but given the positive correlation be-\\ntween gold and copper noted above, it is unlikely that gold\\ngrades exceed 0.01 ppm. Molybdenum is visually estimated at\\nless than 0.05 percent MoS 2. Trace amounts of chalcopyrite\\nand pyrite were observed in polished thin sections. \\nMegascopically, the A-quartz veins appear slightly less vit-\\nreous than those within the Cu-Au orebody and display a\\nmilky white color in hand sample (Fig. 5H). In CL, these\\nveins are composed of anhedral grains of poorly zoned Q1\\nquartz. K-feldspar alteration halos are not well developed and\\nthere are no zones of intense potassic alteration. A5 quartz\\nveinlets are extremely rare and sulfide poor. \\nFluid inclusions in these deep quartz veins trapped a sin-\\ngle-phase, CO 2-rich, low-salinity magmatic fluid. This fluid\\nascended and deposited quartz but little sulfide before sepa-\\nrating into a brine and vapor approx. 500 m (~1,000 m elev)\\nbelow the porphyry-hosted orebody at temperatures of\\naround 550° to 500°C (Redmond, 2002; Redmond et al.,\\n2004; Landtwing et al., 2005). Landtwing et al. (2005) showed\\nthat the single-phase magmatic fluid transported on the order\\nof 10,000 ppm copper.\\nCL petrography also shows that quartz dissolution textures\\nare very common in all quartz-vein types in these deep drill\\nholes and dissolution vugs are filled with molybdenite, calcite,\\nand zeolite minerals (Redmond, 2002), but not with Q2\\nquartz. Dissolution textures are best developed in quartz\\nmolybdenite veins. A-quartz veins are cut and offset by\\nquartz-molybdenum veins (Fig. 5H) that cut a number of thin\\nQLP dikes, a relationship similar to that observed in the Cu-\\nAu orebody at higher elevations. Plagioclase is locally altered\\nto illite-smectite, as it is throughout much of the Bingham\\nstock.\\nDiscussion and Conclusions\\nThrough mapping and petrographic study we have defined\\nand characterized a sequence of structurally controlled por-\\nphyry intrusions, vein formation, and associated wall-rock al-\\nteration leading to Cu-Au-Mo ore formation. The observationspresented above lead to conclusions regarding both genetic\\nand exploration aspects of porphyry copper deposits. \\nStructural controls of dikes, veins, and grade patterns\\nOre-related porphyry dikes in the Bingham pit were em-\\nplaced along steeply dipping, north-northeast–striking faults\\nof probable extensional origin (Presnell, 1998). This struc-\\ntural control is seen at the district scale where porphyry dikes\\nextend over distances of 6 to 10 km along the same north-\\nnortheast trend (e.g., Lanier et al., 1978a). \\nNorth-northeast–striking LP and QLP have northwest-\\nstriking apophyses and thickened nodes at intersections of\\nnorth-northeast– and northwest-striking faults (Fig. 3). These\\nintersections also are marked by abundant quartz veins paral-\\nlel to these two fault sets, intense potassic alteration, and\\nhigh-grade Cu-Au mineralization in LP and QLP (Figs. 10,\\n11). We suggest that flow of magmatic-hydrothermal fluids\\nwithin successive porphyries was focused at these structural\\nintersections.\\nVein attitudes in porphyry-type deposits are variable\\nthrough time, reflecting changing stress regimes imposed\\nboth by the magmatic system and regional tectonic stresses\\n(e.g., Tosdal and Richards, 2001). Attitudes of ore-related\\nquartz veins yield information not only on stress fields and\\nfluid flow (Gruen et al., 2010) but also on structural control of\\nmetal grades that can be applied in exploration, ore reserve\\nestimation, and mining. At El Salvador, Chile, A-veins are\\nrandomly oriented, B-veins commonly have flat dips, and D-\\nveins show a radial pattern centered on the late porphyry\\n(Gustafson and Hunt, 1975). At Bajo de la Alumbrera, Ar-\\ngentina (Proffett, 2003), peripheral dikes define a radial pat-\\ntern centered on irregular stocks, but a weak north-northwest\\ntrend could be either local or regional in origin. D-veins oc-\\ncupy both radial and concentric fractures. At the Endeavor\\nporphyry Cu-Au deposits, Australia (Heithersay and Walshe,\\n1995; Lickfold et al., 2003), early ore-bearing quartz veins oc-\\ncupy intrusion-centered fractures, whereas veins with hy-\\ndrolytic alteration suggest that late fluid flow shifted to a far-\\nfield stress regime. \\nIn contrast to the above examples, some porphyry deposits\\nhave veins and intrusions that reflect mostly far-field stresses.\\nOre-related A-veins with potassic alteration at the Yerington\\nmine, Nevada (Carten, 1986), occurred mostly in steep,\\nsheeted fractures parallel to the northwest strike of dike\\nswarms and zones of high-grade copper. At structurally\\ndeeper levels within the cupola below the Yerington mine\\norebody and in deep exposures at the nearby Ann-Mason Pass\\ndeposit (Dilles and Einaudi, 1992), barren quartz-oligoclase\\nveins are preferentially oriented along the same regional\\nnorthwest trend. Bingham fits the category of deposits con-\\ntrolled by regional structure, similar to the Yerington mine\\nand Ann-Mason Pass. \\nOne-phase low-salinity fluids and depth to magma source\\nFluid inclusions in quartz veins from >500 m below the\\nhigh-grade orebody in QMP trapped a single-phase, CO 2-\\nrich, low-salinity magmatic fluid (Redmond, 2002; Redmond\\net al., 2004, Landtwing et al., 2005, 2010). Similar fluid inclu-\\nsions have rarely been identified in porphyry systems (Roberts,\\n1973; John, 1989; Rusk et al., 2008) because the trapping of60 REDMOND AND EINAUDI\\n0361-0128/98/000/000-00 $6.00 60\\nsuch fluids takes place at depths not generally exposed and\\nsampled or because such fluid inclusions are present more\\ncommonly in deposits with deep source regions. Depth to\\nsource region may have a fundamental effect on the charac-\\nteristics of associated porphyry deposits (Proffett, 2009), in-\\ncluding vein types, early alteration styles, sulfide-oxide min-\\neral assemblages, and temporal relations between porphyry\\nintrusions and ore-grade copper. Following Proffett’s (2009)\\ncriteria, Bingham appears to have characteristics of both deep\\nand shallow source regions, suggesting an intermediate depth\\nto magmatic sources of fluids of about 5 km. If this is the case,\\nand given the paleodepth estimates of 2.0 km for the present\\npit bottom (Redmond et al., 2004), then the source cupola\\nunderlying Bingham was located at 3.0 km below the current\\nbase of the pit.\\nRole of mafic magmas\\nBP , the third in a sequence of five porphyries mapped dur-\\ning the current study, is relatively mafic in composition (App.\\n2, Table 1). BP contains 59 to 62 wt percent SiO 2, but it is\\nclearly not the same as the minette dike described by Keith et\\nal. (1998). The abundance of biotite (10–15%) and relatively\\nhigh chromium content (270–370 ppm), however, suggest an\\naffinity with primitive alkaline magmas. The occurrence of\\nthis mineralized mafic dike within the sequence of porphyry\\nintrusions appears to further support the hypothesis that\\nmafic magmas interacted with latitic magmas in the parent\\nmagma chamber below Bingham and contributed metals and\\nvolatiles to the system (Keith et al., 1998). However, based on\\nour study, if mafic magmas contributed ore-forming compo-\\nnents, this contribution was only significant prior to and/or\\nduring QMP time as the decline in grade of successive por-\\nphyries indicates a depletion of metals and volatiles in the\\nmagma chamber through time. \\nMultiple cycles of porphyry dike emplacement, \\nvein formation, and sulfide deposition \\nMapped relationships between veins and porphyry intru-\\nsive contacts show that each porphyry emplacement event\\nwas followed by a similar sequence of vein formation and\\npotassic alteration leading to copper-iron sulfide and gold de-\\nposition (Fig. 12). All five porphyry intrusions contain zones\\nof abundant A-quartz veins, intense potassic alteration, and\\nhigh-grade copper-gold ore. However, QMP , the first and vol-\\numetrically largest porphyry intrusion, hosts the bulk of the\\nhigh-grade copper-gold ore. Vein-dike relationships indicate\\nthat this high-grade ore in QMP is not the product of multi-\\nple episodes of overprinting or of continuous flux of ore-bear-\\ning hydrothermal fluids, as has been suggested in a number of\\nother porphyry deposits such as the Yerington mine, Nevada\\n(Einaudi et al., unpub. data, 1969–1982; Proffett, 2009), and\\nthe Henderson porphyry molybdenum deposit, Colorado\\n(Seedorff and Einaudi, 2004). At Bingham, we argue against\\nsignificant grade increases from overprinting on the basis of\\nthe following: (1) lack of any symmetry in copper grades sur-\\nrounding dikes that postdate QMP , and (2) absence of a\\nmapped relation between >0.7 percent Cu and the location of\\nlate dikes (Fig. 10).\\nWe conclude that the flux of magmatic-hydrothermal fluids\\nand the mass of introduced copper and gold decreasedmarkedly through time as each successive porphyry intrusive-\\nhydrothermal cycle depleted the underlying parent magma\\nchamber of metals and volatiles. Similar patterns of declining\\ngrade through successive porphyry intrusions are observed at\\nmany but not all (Proffett, 2009) porphyry deposits, including\\nEl Salvador, Chile (Gustafson and Hunt, 1975), Bajo de la\\nAlumbrera, Argentina (Proffett, 2003), Los Pelambres, Chile\\n(Atkinson et al., 1996), the Endeavor deposits, Australia (Hei-\\nthersay and Walshe, 1995; Lickfold et al., 2003), and Ccacalla,\\nCotabambas, Peru (Perelló et al., 2004). The presence of late,\\nlow-grade porphyry intrusions has a bearing on exploration\\nand mining, especially where these late intrusions are large\\nand emplaced in the center of the intrusive complex. At Bing-\\nham, late porphyries, being narrow dikes, caused minimal di-\\nlution and do not present significant difficulties in mining.\\nSequence of vein formation \\nEDM veins predate A-quartz veins in numerous porphyry\\ndeposits, including the type locality, Butte, Montana (Meyer,\\n1965), Los Pelambres (type 4 veins of Atkinson et al., 1996),\\nEl Salvador (EB and C veins of Gustafson and Quiroga,\\n1995), and Ann-Mason Pass, Nevada (Proffett, 2009). Al-\\nthough EDM halos at Bingham do not contribute signifi-\\ncantly to copper grades, in other deposits these veins repre-\\nsent a major early mineralization style. For example, at Butte,\\nMontanna (Brimhall, 1973, 1977), and in the Chuquicamata\\ndistrict, Chile (Proffett, 2009), EDM halos constitute the\\nhigher grade parts of the potassic-related ores.\\nA-quartz veins in QMP display a progression from irregular\\nwavy to straight-walled with time. This pattern is similar to\\nthe changes in quartz vein characteristics described at other\\nporphyry deposits (e.g., Gustafson and Hunt, 1975) and is\\nconsistent with the transition from plastic to brittle conditions\\nthat occurs as rocks cool (Fournier, 1991, 1999). A-quartz\\nveins from the entire 1,500 m vertical interval examined have\\nK-feldspar halos and are similarly abundant within and below\\nthe QMP copper-gold orebody. In contrast to early A-quartz\\nveins, A5 veinlets are far less abundant below the orebody, co-\\nincident with a reduction in copper-gold grades, potassic al-\\nteration intensity, and bornite/chalcopyrite ratios.\\nQuartz-molybdenite veins constitute the bulk of the molyb-\\ndenum ore at Bingham, postdate the emplacement of the last\\nporphyry (QLP) and are in turn cut and offset by late quartz-\\nsericite-pyrite veins. A relatively late age for molybdenum\\nmineralization is supported by the Re-Os dating of Chesley\\nand Ruiz (1998). The late timing of molydenum deposition is\\nfurther supported by the lack of correlation between molyb-\\ndenum and copper grades in the orebody. \\nSpace-time model of orebody formation\\nThe temporal sequence of veins, wall-rock alteration, and\\nsulfides detailed above, combined with P-T data from fluid\\ninclusions studies (Redmond, 2002; Redmond et al., 2004;\\nLandtwing et al., 2005, 2010) allow us to illustrate the space-\\ntime-temperature evolution veins and ore deposition in the\\nQMP-LP zone (Fig. 12).\\nBornite-chalcopyrite-bearing EDM halos represent the\\nearliest sulfide-depositional event at Bingham.

Although we conducted no\\nfluid inclusion studies on EDM veins, temperatures of ~550°–\\n500°C are required by the K-feldspar-andalusite-muscovite\\nassemblage at near-lithostatic pressure at the 2 km paleodepth\\nestimated for Bingham (Hemley and Hunt, 1992). EDM halos\\nprovide the strongest evidence in porphyry copper deposits\\nfor copper deposition at temperatures >500°C. Furthermore,\\nduring each period of EDM formation, no A-quartz veins\\nformed (Fig. 12). Therefore, A-quartz veins and major sulfide\\ndeposition represent episodic pulses of hydrothermal fluid fol-\\nlowing each intrusion, rather than representing a continuousflux of hydrothermal fluids, at declining intensity, throughout\\nthe period of multiple porphyry intrusions.\\nRedmond et al. (2004) showed that, following the forma-\\ntion of EDM veins, an ascending, single-phase magmatic fluid\\nformed barren quartz veins at depth prior to phase separation\\n(Fig. 12). Phase separation to coexisting brine and vapor took\\nplace approx. 500 m below the base of the high-grade ore-\\nbody of the QMP-LP zone at 550° to 500°C and ~625 bars\\npressure (Redmond et al., 2004; Landtwing et al., 2005, 2010).\\nBrine and vapor continued to ascend and cool, due to expan-\\nsion and heat loss to the wall rocks, forming A1-A4 quartz\\nveins and associated potassic alteration.62 REDMOND AND EINAUDI\\n0361-0128/98/000/000-00 $6.00 6260%\\nMAGMA0\\n2\\n4\\n6\\n38.6 MaBingham\\nmonzonite\\n37.7 - 37.0 MaDepth (km)\\nTime (early to late intrusions)paleosurface\\nQMP\\nQLPQLPbxLP\\nBPEDMEDM EDM qtz vnssnsnv\\nqqtqqt\\nqtz vnsqtz vnsnnss\\nv\\nqtz-moly vnsD-veinsclay alterationyounger volcanics\\npre-mine\\nsurface\\ndeepest\\ndrill holes1997\\npit bottomolder volcanics\\nhigh-grade\\nbn-cp ore\\nMo\\nore\\n300  C\\no200  C\\no\\n600  C\\no\\n600  C\\no600  C\\no500  C\\no500  C\\no400  C\\no400  C\\no\\n400  C\\no\\n500  C\\no300  Co\\none-phase\\nfluidvapor + brine?\\n?????\\nEDM halos\\nquartz veins,\\nbarren & A1-A4quartz-moly-\\n(cp) veins\\n~ 0.15 % Cu\\n    bn + cp>0.7 % Cu\\n   bn + cp\\n>0.08 % MoS\\n2?D-veins:\\npervasive QSP\\nalteration \\nillite-smectite\\nalteration of\\nplagioclase\\n(no sulfides)hydrothermal\\nfluid sources &\\nflow paths\\nmagmaticuncertain\\nporphyry intrusionsK-feldspar stable hydrolytic alteration\\nFIG. 12.  Time-space-temperature diagram showing evolution of vein types, alteration, and high-grade copper and molyb-\\ndenum ore based on time lines provided by individual porphyry intrusions. The depth axis is located in center of the QMP-\\nLP zone and relationships shown are based on mapping and core-logging within the depth window of 1.8 to 3.3 km pale-\\nodepths. Temperature contours (dashed black lines) and upper boundary of one-phase fluids (blue bars) are based on fluid\\ninclusion studies of Redmond (2002) and Redmond et al. (2004). Time-space distribution of sericitic alteration at paleo -\\ndepths of <1.5 km is speculative, and this region may have contained silicic and advanced argillic alteration. Abbreviations:\\nbn = bornite, cp = chalcopyrite, moly = molybdenite, QSP = quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration.\\nFluid inclusion data indicate that lithostatic to hydrostatic\\ndecompression occurred during A-quartz vein formation as\\ntemperatures declined to about 425°C (Redmond, 2002). The\\ninferred temperature range is in good agreement with rock\\nmechanics data and observations from active geothermal sys-\\ntems (Fournier, 1991, 1999). The numerous unconformities\\nbetween CL growth zones in A1 to A4 quartz (Fig. 7) indicate\\nthat multiple cycles of quartz precipitation-dissolution-pre-\\ncipitation occurred as a result of pressure fluctuations or cool-\\ning in the P-T region of retrograde quartz solubility\\n(Fournier, 1999). Depressurization from lithostatic to hydro-\\nstatic pressure conditions causes the muscovite-K-feldspar\\nphase boundary to move toward lower (m KCl + K+/mHCl + H+)\\nvalues at any given temperature (Hemley and Hunt, 1992)\\nand would allow hydrothermal fluids to cool even further\\nwhile remaining in the K-feldspar stability field.\\nFormation of A5 quartz veins and associated Cu-Au miner-\\nalization occured within the K-feldspar stability field as tem-\\nperatures declined from 425° to 350°C at hydrostatic pres-\\nsure (Redmond, 2002; Redmond et al., 2004; Landtwing et\\nal., 2005, 2010). We interpret this thermal decline to be the\\ndriving force for Cu-Fe sulfide deposition, given the lack of\\nevidence of mixing of hydrothermal fluids with low-salinity\\nwaters, the lack of correspondence of the ore zone with the\\ninitiation of phase separation, and no change in wall-rock al-\\nteration style. This conclusion is strongly supported by laser\\nablation ICP-MS analyses which show that copper concentra-\\ntions in fluid inclusions in A5 veinlets drop by two orders of\\nmagnitude, within a narrow pressure-temperature interval\\nbetween 210 and 140 bar and 425° to 350°C (Landtwing et\\nal., 2005). The sharp base to the QMP-LP zone orebody at\\n~1,500 m elevation (500 m above the zone of phase separa-\\ntion) may represent the location of the 425°C isotherm at the\\ntime of ore formation in the QMP-LP zone.\\nThis study provides new evidence and new lines of inquiry\\nregarding the formation of Bingham, and, by analogy, other\\ngiant porphyry copper deposits. The inception of extensional\\nfaulting may have triggered the emplacement of porphyry\\nmagma, but the fact that extension was minor ensured that\\nthese magmas and accompanying volatiles did not vent.\\nStructural intersections may have been particularly effective\\nin localizing zones of high-grade copper-gold ore. Intramin-\\neral mafic dikes suggest an open-system magma chamber at\\ndepth that was replenished through time with ore-forming\\ncomponents, although this may not have been a key factor in\\ngenerating the large Bingham deposit, given that the bulk of\\nthe ore was introduced with the first porphyry intrusion. Fi-\\nnally, EDM halos, a vein type not generally recognized in por-\\nphyry deposits, represent a process, at present poorly under-\\nstood, that led to early, high-temperature deposition of Cu\\nand Au. These early halos formed a low-grade protore that\\nmay have subsequently contributed copper and gold during\\nformation of younger A-quartz veins which host the bulk of\\nthe copper-gold ore.\\nAcknowledgments\\nWe thank Geoff Ballantyne, who helped to get this project\\nstarted and secured funding from Kennecott and access to\\nthe mine.
