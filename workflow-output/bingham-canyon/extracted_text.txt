THE GENETIC link between porphyry copper deposits and
magmatic-hydrothermal processes is well established, based
on mapping and petrological studies (Gustafson and Hunt,
1975; Dilles and Einaudi, 1992; Proffett, 2003), characteris-
tics of fluid inclusions (Roedder, 1971; Nash, 1976; Eastoe,
1978; Bodnar, 1995; Heinrich el al., 1999; Ulrich et al., 1999,
2002; Audetat et al., 2008), light stable isotopes (Sheppard et
al., 1969, 1971; Harris et al., 2005), and analogy with active
volcanic fumaroles and geothermal systems (Henley and Mc-
Nabb, 1978; Hedenquist and Lowenstern, 1994; Einaudi et
al., 2003). Formation of porphyry copper deposits requires
the escape of magma and hydrothermal fluid from a magma
chamber located well below the deposit (Proffett, 2009), and
precipitation of sulfides in structurally focused zones as a con-sequence of cooling, interaction with wall rocks, boiling,
and/or mixing with meteoric waters (Gustafson and Hunt,
1975; Brimhall, 1979; Reynolds and Beane, 1985; Hemley
and Hunt, 1992; Inan and Einaudi, 2002; Harris et al., 2005;
Gruen et al., 2010; Landtwing et al., 2010). 
Historically, papers on Bingham have shown copper and
gold grade boundaries that encompass all porphyry intru-
sions, and the timing of sulfide deposition relative to the in-
trusive sequence and different vein types has not been re-
solved (James et al., 1961; John, E.C., 1978; Phillips et al.,
1998). Of the world’s porphyry copper deposits, Bingham
ranks seventh based on contained copper metal (28 Mt), sec-
ond based on con-
tained gold (1,600 t),
and fifth based on
copper grade (Cooke
et al., 2005). There-

Abstract
The Bingham Canyon porphyry copper-gold-molybdenum deposit is one of the largest and highest-grade
porphyry orebodies in the world. This study focused on the northwest side of the deposit where quartz mon-
zonite porphyry (QMP), the first and largest porphyry intrusion, hosts the bulk of the high-grade copper-gold
ore (>1.0% Cu, >1.0 ppm Au). The north-northeast–trending, high-grade zone had pre-mining dimensions of
1,500 m strike, >300 m vertical, and 500 m width and contained more than 500 million tonnes (Mt) of ore
 associated with potassic alteration and abundant quartz veins. The lack of superimposed sericitic alteration
yielded ideal exposures in which to study the early, high-temperature stages of ore formation, a style of miner-
alization that in many porphyry deposits represents the major period of copper introduction.
We mapped multiple porphyry dikes in the sequence: (1) QMP , (2) latite porphyry (LP), (3) biotite porphyry
(BP), (4) quartz latite porphyry breccia (QLPbx), and (5) quartz latite porphyry (QLP). Porphyry dikes, faults,
and quartz veins are steeply dipping and have two dominant orientations; north-northeast– and northwest-
striking. Dikes have a north-northeast strike but they thicken and develop northwest-trending apophyses and
host high-grade copper-gold zones at intersections with northwest-faults, indicating that magmatic-hydrother-
mal fluids were focused by these structural intersections.
Each porphyry intrusion was accompanied by a similar sequence of veins, potassic alteration, and sulfides.
Biotite veinlets were followed by fractures with early dark micaceous (EDM) halos of sericite, K-feldspar,
 biotite, andalusite, and local corundum containing disseminated bornite-chalcopyrite-gold. EDM halos are cut
by multiple generations of A-quartz veins representing the main Cu-Au ore-forming event. Postdating all
 intrusions are quartz-molybdenite veins followed by quartz-sericite-pyrite veins.
Cathodoluminescence (CL) petrography identified distinct A-quartz veinlets consisting of dark-luminescing
quartz filling fractures and dissolution vugs in earlier A-quartz veins and adjacent porphyry wall rock. These
veinlets contain abundant bornite and chalcopyrite and minor K-feldspar and are closely linked in time to the
introduction of the bulk of the copper and gold. Although a similar sequence of veins was repeated on
 emplacement of all porphyry intrusions, the vein density and intensity of potassic alteration declined with time.
The youngest porphyry, QLP , is mostly weakly mineralized and locally unaltered. These observations indicate
that magmatic-hydrothermal fluids underwent a similar physiochemical evolution during and immediately fol-
lowing emplacement of each of several porphyry dikes. The relationship between EDM veins and A-quartz
veins requires that the flux of magmatic fluid from the magma chamber occurred in an episodic manner as
 opposed to a continuous discharge. 
Vein truncation relationships coupled with abrupt changes in copper-gold grades, sulfide ratios, and potas-
sic alteration intensity at porphyry intrusive contacts indicate that the mass of introduced copper and gold
 decreased significantly during successive porphyry intrusive-hydrothermal cycles, presumably due to depletion
of metals and volatiles in the underlying magma chamber.

Bingham is important to developing theories regarding the
formation of giant, high-grade porphyry deposits.
Our study focuses on the high-grade zone of >1 percent
copper and >1 ppm gold along the axis of porphyry intrusions.
We examine the link between grades of copper and gold rel-
ative to district structure, vein types, and alteration in the
context of time lines established by mapping crosscutting re-
lations between multiple porphyry intrusions. Mapping pro-
vides compelling evidence that a regional structural grain of
extensional origin was the first-order control on dike em-
placement, quartz vein attitudes, and ore trends. Each por-
phyry intrusion was accompanied by a similar sequence, but
at declining intensity, of veins, potassic alteration, and copper-
gold mineralization. We document the presence of early,
high-temperature veins, similar to the early dark micaceous
(EDM) veins of Butte, Montana (Meyer, 1965), that repre-
sent the first, although minor, introduction of copper and gold
at temperatures of 500ºC. We suggest that these veins indi-
cate a magmatic source region at 3.0 km below the present pit
bottom at paleodepths of about 5 km.Methods
We mapped approx. 3,000 m of bench face in the QMP-LP
zone (Fig. 1) at a scale of 1:600, with emphasis on intrusive
contacts between porphyries, age of veins relative to each
other and to porphyries, and changes in vein abundance, sul-
fide ratios, and alteration style across porphyry contacts. In
order to document the grade of individual porphyry dikes and
changes in grade across intrusive contacts, we augmented
mine blast hole and diamond drill hole assays with assays
from 74 representative chip samples (0.5–6 kg in size) from
different porphyry intrusions (see App. 1 for assay data and
sample location map).
Two thousand meters of diamond drill core was logged at
scales of 1:240 and 1:600, using the same approach used for
mapping. Approx. 200 sawed samples were examined using a
binocular microscope. Seventy-five polished thin sections
were studied by standard transmitted and reflected light mi-
croscopy and 30 of these were examined using an SEM and
CL detector.44 REDMOND AND EINAUDI

Geologic Setting and Igneous Rocks
The Bingham porphyry deposit, located in the Oquirrh
Mountains of Utah, is centered on a late Eocene composite
pluton, referred to as the Bingham stock (Butler, 1920), that
intruded a thick sequence of quartzite, calcareous quartzite,
and limestone of the Pennsylvanian Oquirrh Group
(Boutwell, 1905; Welsh and James, 1961; Lanier et al., 1978a;
Babcock et al., 1995) (Figs. 1, 2). The Bingham stock is one
of a series of ore-related granitoid intrusions emplaced along
the east-west –trending Uinta Arch during a period of north-
west-southeast–directed extension in the mid-Tertiary (Butler
et al., 1920; James et al., 1961; Roberts et al., 1965; Zeitz et
al., 1969; Tooker, 1971; Stewart et al., 1977; Constenius, 1996;
Vogel et al., 1997; John, 1998; Presnell, 1998). The Oquirrh
Mountains lie on the eastern edge of the Basin and Range
province and were tilted eastward during extensional faulting
during mid-late Cenozoic time. Estimates of the degree of
postore tilting range from 10° to 25° (Atkinson and Einaudi,
1978; Lanier et al., 1978a; Melker and Geissman, 1998).
The Bingham stock
The Bingham stock is made up of an equigranular monzonite
phase that was intruded by a series of ore-related porphyrydikes. Previous studies have recognized three separate por-
phyries: quartz monzonite porphyry (QMP), latite porphyry
(LP), and quartz latite porphyry (QLP) (Stringham, 1953;
Bray, 1969; Moore, 1970; Moore and Czamanske, 1973;
Lanier et al., 1978a; Babcock et al., 1995; Phillips et al., 1998),
although a minette dike is shown on unpublished mine maps
by B.F. Stringham (ca. 1950) and is described by Deino and
Keith (1998) and Waite et al. (1998). Analysis of zircon yielded
U-Pb isotopic ages for monzonite of 38.55 ± 0.19 Ma (Parry
et al., 2001) and 40Ar/39Ar isotopic ages of hydrothermal bi-
otite in porphyry dikes yield ages ranging from 37.74 ± 0.11
to 37.07 ± 0.21 Ma (Deino and Keith, 1998; Parry et al.,
2001). These data suggest that ore-related hydrothermal al-
teration, associated with the emplacement of the porphyry
dikes, began about 0.75 m.y. after emplacement of the mon-
zonite. Our mapping led to the identification of two previ-
ously unrecognized porphyry intrusions: biotite porphyry (BP)
and quartz latite porphyry breccia (QLPbx). The complete se-
quence of porphyries (from oldest to youngest) is (1) QMP ,
(2) LP , (3) BP , (4) QLPbx, and (5) QLP (Fig. 3, Table 1). 
Quartz monzonite porphyry: QMP is the earliest and volu-
metrically largest porphyry intrusion and contains the highest
copper and gold grades in porphyry-hosted ore. It dips 55°–
60° NW, has a strike length of approx. 1,500 m and a relativelyTHE BINGHAM CANYON PORPHYRY Cu-Mo-Au DEPOSIT: INTRUSIONS, VEIN FORMATION, & SULFIDE DEPOSITION 45

constant width of 350 m to depths of 2 km below the pre-
mine surface (Figs. 1–3). QMP contains 50 to 60 vol percent
phenocrysts of plagioclase, orthoclase, hornblende, biotite,
and rare quartz eyes (Table 1). Unaltered groundmass is
aplitic (50–100 µm) and composed primarily of subequal
amounts of quartz and orthoclase.
Latite porphyry: LP (Bray, 1969; Moore, 1970; Lanier et
al., 1978b) occurs as a series of north-northeast–striking dikes
and sills that extend for over 3 km along the northwest mar-
gin of the Bingham stock (Fig. 1). LP dikes within the QMP-
LP zone are 10 to 80 m wide and dip at 60°–75° NW (Fig. 3).
LP and QMP are similar in terms of phenocryst and ground-
mass composition (Table 1). Contacts between the two por-
phyries are sharp (Fig. 4A), with no chilled margins on LP .
Biotite porphyry: BP cuts both QMP and LP and is in turn
truncated by, and occurs as xenoliths within, QLPbx (Fig.
4D). The dike is much darker in color than the other four por-
phyries owing to the presence of abundant phenocrystic and
groundmass biotite (see App. 2 for whole-rock XRF analyses).
Pit mapping suggests that BP is continuous for 500 m along
its north-northeast strike in the QMP-LP zone, ranges from
2.5 to 4 m wide, and dips 60°–65° NW (Fig. 3). BP contains
significantly more biotite phenocrysts (12–15%) than the
other four porphyries (2–4%, Table 1). K-feldspar and plagio-
clase phenocrysts are locally rounded or embayed, likely the
result of resorption during emplacement. BP contains small,
<5 cm diameter, angular fragments of both QMP and LP . BP
is potassically altered and mineralized throughout the study
area and locally contains high-grade copper-gold ore and A-
quartz veins (e.g., BP sample 5090-1500 assayed 3.5% Cu and
7.1 ppm Au, App. 1). Vein truncation relationships and an
abrupt decrease in copper-gold grades at contacts with later
porphyries indicate the the high grades in BP are not the re-
sult of overprinting by magmatic-hydrothermal fluids from a
younger porphyry intrusion.
Quartz latite porphyry breccia: QLPbx cuts QMP , LP , and
BP and is in turn cut by QLP that locally displays a <1-cm-widechilled margin (Fig. 4C). QLPbx is the only porphyry intru-
sion that contains abundant wall-rock xenoliths. Xenoliths
range in size from <1 to 10 cm width, are angular to sub-
rounded, and make up 20 to 50 vol percent of the rock.
QLPbx bodies have extremely irregular margins, character-
ized by abundant 5- to 50-cm-wide dikelets extending several
meters into adjacent wall rocks and commonly forming
crackle breccia textures. The most extensive exposures of
QLPbx were on the 4890 bench, where a 10- to 20-m-wide
body extended for 150 m along the north-northeast–striking
contact between LP and QMP (Fig. 3). Fragments of QMP
and of LP within QLPbx contain multiple generations of trun-
cated A-quartz veins with bornite-chalcopyrite, indicating
that QLPbx was emplaced after quartz vein formation and
sulfide deposition in LP . In addition, QLPbx contains frag-
ments of BP where it truncates this post-LP dike (Fig. 4D). 
QLPbx contains approx. 11 to 17 vol percent phenocrysts of
plagioclase and K-feldspar and lesser book biotite, biotitized
hornblende, and rare quartz eyes (Table 1). Groundmass is
composed of aplitic-textured K-feldspar, quartz, and biotite.
Unlike the other four porphyries, the groundmass of QLPbx
contains numerous irregular (0.2–1mm) vesicles that make up
2 to 5 vol percent of the groundmass. With the exception of
rare grains of fine-grained biotite, these vesicles are unfilled.
Quartz latite porphyry: QLP dikes, first described by
Stringham (1953), crop out in the pit for over 3 km (Fig. 1).
Wilson (1978) describes an unusual vesicular QLP plug that
contained coarse-grained chalcopyrite in quartz-lined vesicles
but no vesicular QLP was observed during the current study.
Within the mapped area the most continous QLP dike ranges
from <10 to 50 m in width and dip 70° to 85° NW. Northwest-
striking dikelets and bulbous apophyses of QLP are found
where major northwest-striking faults in monzonite project
into the north-northeast–striking QMP-LP zone (Fig. 3). Bi-
otitized QLP is medium brown in color and contains about 30
40 vol percent phenocrysts, including 3 to 7 percent quartz
eyes (Table 1). Nonbiotitized QLP has a dark green color andTHE BINGHAM CANYON PORPHYRY Cu-Mo-Au DEPOSIT: INTRUSIONS, VEIN FORMATION, & SULFIDE DEPOSITION 47

(Fig. 5F). QLP concludes the trend toward increasing abun-
dance of groundmass through the succession of porphyry in-
trusions (Table 1).
Structural control of porphyry dikes
The dominant faults in the district are steeply dipping,
north-northeast–striking faults of probable Mesozoic age re-
activated as normal faults during early Basin and Range ex-
tension (Farmin, 1933; Tooker, 1971; Atkinson and Einaudi,
1978). These north-northeast faults served as conduits for
ore-forming fluids peripheral to the Bingham stock, including
vein and replacement Pb-Zn-Ag ores in the US (Rubright and
Hart, 1968) and Highland Boy mines (Atkinson and Einaudi,
1978). The most continuous of the north-northeast faults
mapped in the open pit, the Main Hill fault zone (Fig. 1), was
expressed by pre-mine topography as a deeply incised tribu-
tary to Bingham Canyon known as Carr fork (figs. 2, 3 in
James, 1978). This fault projects into the main porphyry dike
swarm and it is likely that the porphyry dike complex was em-
placed along this fault zone.
In addition to the dominant north-northeast faults, a set of
northwest-striking faults dipping 50°–85° SW are a secondary
control on dike emplacement. The most continuous north-
west faults in the open pit are the Giant Chief (Smith, 1975)
and Copper Center faults (Fig. 1). Again, pre-mine topogra-
phy reflects the Giant Chief-Copper Canyon fault zone in the
southeast trend of upper Bingham Canyon (figs. 2, 3 in James,
1978).
James et al. (1961) suggested that the zone of intersection
of north-northeast and northwest faults was a fundamental
control on localizing the Bingham stock at the district scale.
At the mine scale, porphyry dikes may have intruded the
north-northeast faults. This study demonstrates that locally
LP and QLP formed thickened nodes and northwest-striking
apophyses at intersections of northwest and north-northeast
faults. More importantly, below we present evidence that
zones of high quartz vein abundance and high-grade copper-
gold ore (defined here as >1% Cu and >1 ppm Au) within the
QMP-LP zone are localized at intersections of north-north-
east and northwest faults and that the strikes of quartz veinsreflect the north-northeast and northwest structural grain of
the district.
Veins, Wall-Rock Alteration, and Sulfide Mineralization
Based on our mapping, we have identified a sequence of
veins that formed after the intrusion of each porphyry, and,
therefore, in a cyclical sequence repeated at least four times
(EDM veins were not recorded in BP). A single sequence
consists, from early to late (Table 2), of (1) biotite veinlets, (2)
EDM veins, and (3) A-quartz veins, all intimately associated
with potassic alteration. Postdating all intrusions are (4)
quartz-molybdenite veins, and (5) minor, youngest quartz-
sericite-pyrite veins.
Biotite veinlets
Wispy biotite veinlets are the earliest vein type at Bingham
(Phillips et al., 1998), occurring in low abundance in all five
porphyries. Our mapping typically found 5 to 10 veinlets per
10 m of drill core or bench face. Biotite veinlets are typically
a few centimeters long, 0.5 to 1.0 mm wide, and are com-
posed of medium-brown biotite with no magnetite. Biotite
veinlets contain Cu-Fe sulfides only in cases where they are
adjacent to younger veins that contain abundant Cu-Fe sul-
fides. We interpret this textural relationship to indicate that
Cu-Fe sulfides were not deposited contemporaneously with
biotite veinlets, but were a later addition. 
Early dark micaceous veins 
EDM veins, following the terminology of Meyer (1965), are
characterized by unfilled fractures with alteration halos in
which plagioclase phenocrysts are replaced by andalusite
(10–15%), biotite (15–20%), sericite (30–40%), and K-
feldspar (25–45%) (Figs. 4, 5). Trace corundum (<1%) is not
in contact with rare quartz. EDM halos are 5 to 40 mm wide
and are continuous over several meters. Andalusite and bi-
otite are locally replaced by sericite, which is in turn replaced
by K-feldspar, a reaction sequence recognized in EDM veins
at Butte, Montana (Meyer, 1965; Brimhall, 1977). K-feldspar
partially to completely replaces plagioclase phenocrysts in
high-grade samples that also contain younger A-quartz veins
with K-feldspar halos. This relationship suggests that at leastTHE BINGHAM CANYON PORPHYRY Cu-Mo-Au DEPOSIT: INTRUSIONS, VEIN FORMATION, & SULFIDE DEPOSITION 49

separately. The QMP xenolith sample (sample no. 5190-1910A; sample weight 840 grams) assayed 2.2 percent copper and
5.6 ppm gold. The QLPbx sample (sample no. 5190-1910B; sample weight 1,070 grams) assayed 0.21 percent copper and 3.7
ppm gold. QMP is potassically altered (weakly developed;, see Table 3). Alkali feldspar phenocrysts are replaced by K-
feldspar, hornblende is replaced by shreddy hydrothermal biotite and plagioclase phenocrysts are yellow in color due to late
illite-smectite alteration. C. Intrusive contact between QLP and QLPbx. Note the xenoliths of QMP with a truncated EDM
vein within QLPbx. Yellow color is due to late illite-smectite alteration of plagioclase as in Figure 4B. Sample no. 4990-2150.

some of this K-feldspar may be related to A-quartz vein for-
mation. EDM halos in the QMP-LP zone contain 1 to 4 per-
cent bornite ± digenite and chalcopyrite, mostly as dissemi-
nated grains within biotite and K-feldspar but locally in
contact with sericite. One sample of an individual EDM halo
in QMP assayed 1.5 percent Cu and 2.6 ppm Au (App. 1,sample no. 5090-1545). We estimate that EDM-hosted sul-
fides contribute on the order of 1 to 2 percent of the total
copper and gold in the high-grade areas of the QMP-LP zone.
EDM vein abundance, highest in QMP , ranges from 1 to 8

3Usually appears to be related to later quartz-sericite-pyrite stage of alteration
truncation relationships at porphyry contacts (Fig. 4G, E) in-
dicate that EDM veins formed during each period of por-
phyry intrusion. Within each porphyry, EDM veins are cut
and offset by multiple generations of A-quartz veins (Fig. 5A).
EDM vein abundance is constant within and immediately
below the high-grade copper-gold orebody in QMP . Based on
logging of drill core in the QMP-LP zone, EDM veins are
present from 1,150 m elevation (i.e., 350 m below the base of
the high-grade ore) up through the shallowest drill core in-
tersections examined (~1,700 m elev). Therefore, the mini-
mum vertical extent of EDM veins is approx. 550 m. 
A-quartz veins
A-quartz veins, as defined by Gustafson and Hunt (1975),
are the most abundant vein type in the porphyry orebody (Fig
5A); in QMP they locally exceed 25 vol percent of the rock.
Most are 0.5 to 2 cm wide, but some are up to 15 cm wide.
Our mapping in the QMP-LP zone shows that the majority of
A-veins occur in two dominant sets: north-northeast– and
northwest-striking (Figs. 6, 7). A-veins contain digentite, bor-
nite, chalcopyrite, and rare molybdenite. Digenite forms mu-
tual boundaries, lamellae, or grating textures in bornite, but isnot in contact with chalcopyrite. Gold grades correlate strongly
with copper grades (Fig. 8) and with zones rich in digenite-
bornite. Gold occurs predominantly as high-fineness grains 5
to 20 m in diameter (Redmond, 2002).
A-quartz veins occur in all five porphyries, but they are
most abundant in QMP , in which four subtypes are recog-
nized megascopically on the basis of structure, texture, and
crosscutting relations. These four subtypes are termed A1 to
A4 in relative age sequence, with A1 the oldest (Table 2). The
sequence A1 to A4, well-defined in QMP , but less so in the
younger porphyries, displays a temporal progression from ir-
regular wavy to straight-walled. A1 veins are the most irregu-
lar and discontinuous, pinching and swelling along their
length (Fig. 5C, D). A2 veins commonly occur in sheeted sets
and are sinuous and curved (Fig. 5E, F). A3 veins typically
contain thin growth zones of hydrothermal K-feldspar that
are subparallel to the vein walls, giving these veins a banded
appearance (Fig. 5C, D), similar to the “banding of K-spar”
described in some A-quartz veins at El Salvador (Gustafson
and Hunt, 1975, p. 882). A4 veins are the most abundant and
have relatively straight walls but do not have an obvious cen-
ter line (Fig. 5C, D). Thin sections of A1 to A4 veins reveal52 REDMOND AND EINAUDI

interlocking anhedral quartz grains, 0.1 to 5 mm in diameter,
that are brightly luminescing and weakly zoned in CL, most
commonly exhibiting an irregular blotchy texture. We refer to
this quartz as Q1 quartz (Fig. 7). 
A5 quartz-sulfide veinlets, the dominant ore hosts, are only
visible using CL microscopy. They consist of fine-grained
(0.01–0.1 mm) dark-luminescing quartz, referred to as Q2
quartz. CL petrography shows that A5 veinlets are typically
0.01 to 0.1 mm wide and range from millimeters to a few cen-
timeters in length. Within the QMP-hosted orebody, all A1 to
A4 veins and immediately adjacent porphyry wall rock are cut
by numerous A5 veinlets and irregular vugs filled with Q2
quartz, and varying amounts of copper-iron sulfides anddark-luminescing K-feldspar (Fig. 7). Vug margins truncate
growth zones in Q1 quartz grains, indicating that vug forma-
tion involved quartz dissolution. A5 veinlets and vugs cutting
earlier A-veins occur in all five porphyry intrusions (Fig. 7).
These are the youngest veinlets in any given intrusion-miner-
alization event, host the majority of Cu-Fe sulfides, and are
therefore the most closely linked in time to the deposition of
 copper and gold. Fluid inclusions in Q2 quartz show that cop-
per-iron sulfides in A5 veinlets were precipitated at tempera-
tures of 425° to 350°C (Redmond, 2002; Redmond et al.,
2004; Landtwing et al., 2005, 2010). Fluid inclusion data also
show that lithostatic to hydrostatic decompression occurring
during A-quartz vein formation as temperatures declined to
around 425°C (Redmond, 2002).
A5 veinlets and vugs also occur within wall rock adjacent to
A1 to A4 veins but are less continuous, more irregular, and
contain more K-feldspar than A5 veinlets cutting A1 to A4
veins. A5 veinlets commonly contain K-feldspar as a veinlet-
filling mineral where they cut alkali feldspar phenocrysts and
quartz where they cut quartz grains (Redmond et al., 2004;
fig. 1.10). These textures suggest that the vein-forming fluids
were close to saturation with quartz and K-feldspar and that
wall-rock minerals acted as seed crystals. 
Whereas thicker A5 veinlets commonly extend across con-
tacts between A1to A4 veins and wall rock, thinner A5 vein-
lets in A1 to A4 veins tend to terminate at vein margins. These
textures suggest that rheological differences focused A5 frac-
turing in earlier A1 to A4 quartz veins rather than in wall rock,
which resulted in the correlation between higher copper-gold
grades and abundance of A1 to A4 veins within (but not
below) the QMP orebody.
Intense quartz-K-feldspar alteration
Potassic alteration styles range from weak (biotitization of
hornblende with porphyry texture preserved) to strong (gran-
ular, vuggy quartz and K-feldspar with porphyry texture oblit-
erated) (Table 3). Within the high-grade QMP-LP zone, the
overall intensity of potassic alteration is a function of A-quartz
vein abundance. 
Zones of intense quartz-K-feldspar alteration are found
where A-quartz veins constitute ≥10 vol percent of the rock
and alteration halos overlap. Such alteration occurs locally in
LP , QLPbx, and QLP , but zones up to 10 m across were ob-
served only in the high-grade copper-gold zone in QMP where
grades commonly exceed 2.0 percent copper and 4 ppm
gold. In bench faces, these zones are visually striking, with
abundant vitreous A-quartz veins and grayish-white wall
rock composed of a granular (0.2–1.0 mm) intergrowth of
quartz and K-feldspar grains, 1- to 3-mm orange-brown bi-
otite flakes, and gaudy millimeter-sized bornite-digenite
and chalcopyrite grains (Fig. 5G). Irregular blocky A1
quartz veins, commonly with brecciated textures, are par-
ticularly abundant within these zones. CL petrography
shows that entire thin sections (veins and porphyry wall
rock) contain a closely spaced network of A5 quartz veinlets
and vugs containing abundant copper-iron sulfides. In thin
section, biotite flakes are replaced along their margins by
quartz, and early biotite veinlets and EDM veins are ab-
sent, having presumably been completely replaced by
quartz-K-feldspar.54 REDMOND AND EINAUDI

grade and bornite/chalcopyrite ratio for 14 samples (of the 74 plotted on A).
These small, well-constrained samples were collected in the open pit, and
represent four of the five porphyry intrusions. 
Quartz-molybdenite veins
The bulk of the molybdenite in the QMP-LP zone occurs
in quartz-molybdenite veins that cut and offset A-quartz veins
in all five porphyry intrusions. No truncated quartz-molybde-
num veins were observed at porphyry contacts or within the
numerous xenoliths of QMP , LP , and BP examined in expo-
sures of QLPbx. Thus, these veins postdate all intrusive activ-
ity (Fig. 4G). Trace molybdenite occurs locally as isolated
grains with copper-iron sulfides in some A-quartz veins and
may or may not have been deposited at the same time as
quartz-molybdenum veins. 
Quartz-molybdenite veins within the open pit, above 1,500
m elevation, are typically 5 to 50 mm wide and are composed
of 1 to 10 mm euhedral quartz crystals that are well zoned in
CL and have a well-developed vuggy centerline. They com-
monly contain trace chalcopyrite. In contrast, quartz-molyb-
denite veins from deep drill holes (A51 and A57 between 100
and 650 m elev) are 1 to 7 mm wide, contain fine-grained
quartz, no chalcopyrite, and are commonly wavy and lack a
well-developed centerline (Fig. 5H). CL petrography clearly
shows that the bulk of the molybdenite in these veins was de-
posited on the walls of dissolution vugs. The remaining poros-
ity in these vugs is filled by zeolite and/or calcite that are
probably younger than the molybdenite (Redmond, 2002, fig.
1.28). Quartz-molybdenite veins at depth cut and offset bar-
ren A-quartz veins (Fig. 5H) and also cut thin QLP dikes.
Late hydrolytic alteration 
Pyrite veins with quartz-sericite-pyrite halos (D-veins of
Gustafson and Hunt, 1975) cut and offset quartz veins and
quartz-molybdenum veins (Fig. 4H). D-veins are extremely
rare in the QMP-LP zone; we mapped less than 50 D-veins in
3,000 m of bench face. The vein-filling material in these veins
was dominated by pyrite (<95%) with local minor chalcopy-
rite and quartz. Veins were typically 5 mm wide with selvages
ranging from 10 to 30 mm wide. However, on strike to the
northeast and southwest and at higher elevations, D-veins are
more abundant and vein selvages locally overlap to form >10
m wide zones of pervasive sericitic alteration (Lanier et al.,1978b; Babcock et al., 1995; Inan and Einaudi, 2002; Parry et
al., 2002). 
Mixtures of smectite, illite, ± kaolinite replace plagioclase
phenocrysts to varying degrees throughout the Bingham stock
but this alteration is most common along north-northeast–
striking faults and fractures (Atkinson and Einaudi, 1978;
Lanier et al., 1978a). Illite-smectite alteration does not affect
K-feldspar and biotite (Fig. 4B–D, G). Within zones of in-
tense K-feldspar-quartz alteration, where plagioclase phe-
nocrysts were totally replaced by K-feldspar in earlier stages,
this late argillic alteration is absent because of the lack of pla-
gioclase. Late argillic alteration does not appear to be related
to any vein type, is not accompanied by sulfides, and neither
alters the local bornite/chalcopyrite ratios nor the grade pat-
terns. 
Changes in Mineralization Intensity across 
Porphyry Contacts
Within the QMP-LP zone, there is generally an abrupt de-
crease in abundance of A-quartz veins, intensity of potassic al-
teration, bornite/chalcopyrite ratios and copper-gold grades
across contacts from older to younger porphyries (Fig. 9). 
Quartz vein abundance
Most A-quartz veins (> 90%) in QMP were truncated by
LP (Fig. 4A), indicating that the bulk of ore-forming hy-
drothermal activity in QMP took place before the intrusion of
LP . However, a small percentage (<10%) of Cu-Fe sulfide-
bearing A-quartz veins cut the LP-QMP contact, indicating
that some copper and gold were also introduced into QMP
after emplacement of LP . BP , in turn, truncates most A-
quartz veins in LP . All exposures of QLPbx contain abundant
fragments of earlier porphyries with truncated A-veins (Fig.
4B). QLP in turn truncates most A-veins in QLPbx. Average
quartz vein abundance declines within each of the five suc-
cessive porphyries in the QMP-LP zone, as follows: QMP 5 to
15 percent (by volume), LP 1 to 5 percent , BP 1 to 5 percent,
QLPbx 1 to 2 percent, and QLP <1 percent (Fig. 9A). How-
ever, four of the five porphyries (all except BP) locally containTHE BINGHAM CANYON PORPHYRY Cu-Mo-Au DEPOSIT: INTRUSIONS, VEIN FORMATION, & SULFIDE DEPOSITION 55

zones 1 to 10 m wide of greater than 25 vol percent quartz
veins and associated intense potassic alteration and high-
grade copper-gold ore.
Potassic alteration intensity
Potassic alteration intensity (Table 3), as seen in cross sec-
tion through the QMP-LP zone (Fig. 9B), is highest in QMP .
Zones of intense potassic alteration are enclosed within a
larger zone of moderate potassic alteration that corresponds
closely with the zone of >0.7 percent copper. All younger por-
phyry dikes have weak to moderate potassic alteration, al-
though both LP and QLP (Fig. 5F) locally contain meter-
scale zones of moderate to intense potassic alteration. QLP
contains areas, on the order of 10 to 30 m across, that are un-
altered except along rare A-quartz veins with selvages in
which hornblende phenocrysts are biotitized (Fig. 4F).
Bornite/chalcopyrite ratios
The bornite/chalcopyrite and bornite/digenite ratios of ore
in the QMP-LP zone vary considerably both within and be-
tween porphyry intrusions (Fig. 9C). The highest bornite/
chalcopyrite ratios (1:2–1:1) are found in QMP . In the central
portion of this zone (around drill hole D211) bornite/chal-
copyrite ratios are greater than 1:1 and locally range up to
10:1. Digenite lamellae in bornite are observed in amounts
subequal to bornite only within QMP . An abrupt decrease in
bornite/chalcopyrite ratio occurs across the contact from
QMP to LP (Fig. 9C); LP is generally chalcopyrite dominant.
Exceptions are two narrow LP dikes logged in drill hole D211
and the high-grade (>1% copper) zone in LP around drill
hole D216 (Fig. 10) in which bornite is more abundant than
chalcopyrite. Chalcopyrite-only and composite chalcopyrite-
bornite grains constitute the bulk (>95%) of sulfides in LP;
bornite grains with grating-textured digenite are rare. Bor-
nite/chalcopyrite ratios in QLP are generally less than 1:2 (Fig
9C). These observations indicate that bornite/chalcopyrite ra-
tios, and therefore bulk Cu/Fe ratios of sulfides declined with
time through the succession of intrusions. 
Copper and gold grades
Published grade maps of the Bingham pit (Phillips et al.,
1998, their fig. 4) show zones of >1.0, 0.7 to 1.0, and >0.35
percent copper, but grade contours are smoothed across por-
phyry contacts. In order to document copper and gold grades
that reflect observed grade changes across dike contacts, we
have interpreted assays from approx. 10-m-spaced blast holes,
drill core, and our chip samples (see App. 1 for sample loca-
tions), based on mapped relations on pit benches and in drill
core (Figs. 10, 11).56 REDMOND AND EINAUDI

FIG. 11.  Map (A) and cross section (B) show-
ing gold grades in QMP-LP zone. Data sources
the same as Figure 10. Rock-type contacts are
shown as thin black lines.
Within the QMP-LP zone, high-grade copper-gold ore oc-
curs in all five porphyry intrusions and within the equigranu-
lar monzonite although the volumes contained in porphyries
that postdate QMP are relatively small. The bulk of the high-
grade copper-gold ore in the QMP-LP zone is hosted in QMP
and monzonite. The zone of >1.0 percent Cu in QMP (at the
1998–1999 pit surface) had dimensions of only 250 ×150 m
in plan view (Fig. 10). However, this exposure represented
the remaining basal portion of a much larger volume of high-
grade copper ore in QMP that may have extended up to the
pre-mining surface, a vertical distance of greater than 500 m
(Fig. 10). This zone also contains extremely high gold grades,
particularly around drill hole D211, which intersected over
100 m of >3 ppm gold. This high-grade ore occurs at the in-
tersection of the north-northeast porphyry trend (Main Hill
fault zone) and the projection of the northwest-striking Giant
Chief fault (Fig. 1), and the majority of A-quartz veins in this
zone mimic these structural trends (Fig. 6). Both copper and
gold grades drop off sharply within QMP below approx. 1,500
m elevation, from >1 to <0.35 percent Cu, and from >1 to
<0.15 ppm Au over a vertical distance of 35 to 100 m (Figs. 9,
10). This abrupt decline in copper and gold grades at approx.
1,500 m elevation is observed along the entire strike length of
QMP and in equigranular monzonite at the southwest and
northeast ends of QMP—a strike length of approx. 2 km. 
Within the mapped area, LP generally contains lower grades
of copper and gold than QMP and grades drop abruptly across
QMP-LP contacts (Figs. 10, 11). For example, across a con-
tact from QMP (sample 4990-1380, see App. 1) to LP (sam-
ple 4990-1375, see App. 1) on bench 4990 we documented
the following abrupt changes: copper grade declined from 2.5
to 0.7 percent, gold grade declined from 5.8 to 0.8 ppm, bor-
nite/chalcopyrite ratio declined from 5:1 to 1:7, A-quartz vein
abundance declined from 15 to 5 percent, and intensity of
potassic alteration declined from moderate-locally intense to
weakly developed. A similar drop in grade from 1.9 to 0.5 per-
cent copper and 5.6 to 1.0 ppm gold occurs across the QMP-
LP contact on bench 5190 (see App. 1). We collected repre-
sentative chip samples from QMP (n = 23) and LP (n = 25),
including samples from both sides of intrusive contacts (i.e.,
1–5 m apart). The average grade of QMP in these samples
was 1.3 pecent Cu and 3.5 ppm Au compared to 0.6 percent
Cu and 1.0 ppm Au in adjacent LP . However, LP locally con-
tains high-grade ore: drill hole D126 (Fig. 10) intersected 36
m of LP containing 1.08 percent copper at the intersection of
the north-northeast porphyry trend and the northwest-strik-
ing Copper Center fault, an intersection also marked by an in-
crease in width of the LP dike. Copper-gold grades in LP
drop sharply below 1,500 m elevation, as in QMP .
BP also contains high-grade mineralization with grades lo-
cally exceeding those in adjacent QMP and LP . For example,
a 2-m-wide BP dike mapped on bench 5090 assayed 1.45 per-
cent copper and 3 ppm gold (sample 5090-710, see App. 1).
A representative sample of QMP (sample 5090-713, see App.
1) 3 m northeast of this contact assayed 0.57 percent copper
and 1.7 ppm gold. 
Abundant mineralized fragments of earlier porphyry dikes
commonly increase the overall grade of the QLPbx, but the
inherent grade of this intrusion is low. For example, QMP
xenoliths carefully sawn out of one QLPbx sample (Fig. 4B)contained 2.2 percent copper and 5.7 ppm gold (sample
5190-1910A, see App. 1) whereas the QLPbx matrix con-
tained only 0.2 percent copper and 0.4 ppm gold (sample
5190-1910B, see App. 1). However, QLPbx locally contains
small zones of high-grade copper mineralization—for exam-
ple: at one location on bench 5090 the igneous matrix of
QLPbx was cut by a 2-m-wide zone of abundant 1- to 2-mm-
wide, A2 sheeted quartz veinlets with bornite and chalcopy-
rite and visually estimated grades of >1.5 percent copper.
This high-grade zone in QLPbx is also located at the inter-
section of the north-northeast porphyry trend and the north-
west-striking Copper Center fault, suggesting that this struc-
tural intersection persisted as an upflow zone for mineralizing
fluids through successive porphyry intrusions.
Copper and gold grades in QLP are extremely variable but
the dike is generally significantly lower in grade than adjacent
QMP or LP (Figs. 10, 11). The main northeast-trending por-
tion of QLP contains 0.15 to 0.35 percent copper and 0.15 to
0.3 ppm gold. However, the dike locally contains meter-scale
zones of high-grade mineralization. For example, on bench
5090, a 1- to 3-m-wide zone of abundant A-quartz veins and
associated intense potassic alteration assayed 1.90 percent
copper and 4.5 ppm gold (Fig. 5F, sample 5090-1700, see
App. 1). This high-grade zone is located where the dike thick-
ens and develops a northwest-trending apophysis that is on
trend with the projection of the northwest-trending Giant
Chief fault. Biotitized QLP at the distal ends of northwest-
trending peripheral apophyses contain lower grades of copper
(<0.15%) and unbiotitized zones contain even less copper,
typically less than 200 ppm.
The above observations regarding copper-gold grades can
be summarized as follows (Figs. 10, 11): (1) abrupt grade
changes occur at porphyry contacts, (2) there is a general de-
cline through time in the average copper-gold grade of por-
phyry intrusions, (3) structural intersections between north-
northeast–striking porphyry dikes and northwest-striking
faults focused hydrothermal fluid flow and mark the location
of individual high-grade copper-gold zones in successive por-
phyry intrusions, and (4) an abrupt decline in copper-gold
grades occurs below approx. 1,500 m elevation in all five por-
phyry intrusions along the entire strike length of the QMP-LP
zone. This abrupt decline in grade is limited to the northwest
side of the open pit; elsewhere, relatively high grade mineral-
ization persists to greater depth, forming the deep peripheral
roots of the +0.35 percent Cu zone (Fig. 2). In these roots,
copper grades gradually decrease with depth.
Veins and Alteration below the QMP-LP Zone
We logged three drill holes (D109, D195, and D404) that
pass through the base of the high-grade QMP-LP zone (Figs.
3, 10, 11) in order to document the changes in alteration and
vein types that accompany the abrupt decline in copper and
gold grades below 1,500 m elevation (Figs. 2, 10, 11). 
EDM veins are equally abundant within and immediately
below the high-grade copper-gold orebody in QMP but were
not observed at depths greater than 350 m below the base of
high grade (below ~1,150 m elev). EDM veins within this
350-m interval below the QMP-hosted orebody are cut by
barren A-quartz veins and account for most of low-grade cop-
per (300–500 ppm) present in QMP at these deeper levels. THE BINGHAM CANYON PORPHYRY Cu-Mo-Au DEPOSIT: INTRUSIONS, VEIN FORMATION, & SULFIDE DEPOSITION 59

Below the base of the high-grade copper-gold orebody of
the QMP-LP zone, the abundance of A1 to A4 quartz veins
does not change significantly, but the abundance of sulfide-
bearing A5 veinlets (observed in CL) and intensity of potassic
alteration decline abruptly (Redmond, 2002; figs. 1.17 and
1.18; Fig. 8). Dark luminescing Q2 quartz was observed in
some deep samples from below the orebody (down to 1,090
m elev) but generally occurs as overgrowths on anhedral Q1
quartz grains and not in well-developed A5 veinlets. 
A number of deep drill holes were completed in the 1970s
by The Anaconda Company and two of these drill holes, A51
(1471.2 m deep) and A57 (1942 m deep), intersected QMP
between 150 and 600 m elevation (Fig. 2), that is, over 1 km
below the QMP-hosted copper-gold orebody. QMP in these
deep intersections is pervasively biotitized. Biotite veinlets
are the earliest vein type noted, and EDM veins were not ob-
served. Barren A1 toA4 quartz veins are relatively abundant,
typically 5 to10 vol percent, and similar to the typical abun-
dance of A1-A4 veins in the QMP Cu-Au orebody above
1,500 m elevation. QMP in these deep holes contains only
minor copper: 160 m of 142 ppm copper in hole A57, and 162
m of 155 ppm copper in hole A51. No gold or molybdenum
assays were carried out, but given the positive correlation be-
tween gold and copper noted above, it is unlikely that gold
grades exceed 0.01 ppm. Molybdenum is visually estimated at
less than 0.05 percent MoS 2. Trace amounts of chalcopyrite
and pyrite were observed in polished thin sections. 
Megascopically, the A-quartz veins appear slightly less vit-
reous than those within the Cu-Au orebody and display a
milky white color in hand sample (Fig. 5H). In CL, these
veins are composed of anhedral grains of poorly zoned Q1
quartz. K-feldspar alteration halos are not well developed and
there are no zones of intense potassic alteration. A5 quartz
veinlets are extremely rare and sulfide poor. 
Fluid inclusions in these deep quartz veins trapped a sin-
gle-phase, CO 2-rich, low-salinity magmatic fluid. This fluid
ascended and deposited quartz but little sulfide before sepa-
rating into a brine and vapor approx. 500 m (~1,000 m elev)
below the porphyry-hosted orebody at temperatures of
around 550° to 500°C (Redmond, 2002; Redmond et al.,
2004; Landtwing et al., 2005). Landtwing et al. (2005) showed
that the single-phase magmatic fluid transported on the order
of 10,000 ppm copper.
CL petrography also shows that quartz dissolution textures
are very common in all quartz-vein types in these deep drill
holes and dissolution vugs are filled with molybdenite, calcite,
and zeolite minerals (Redmond, 2002), but not with Q2
quartz. Dissolution textures are best developed in quartz
molybdenite veins. A-quartz veins are cut and offset by
quartz-molybdenum veins (Fig. 5H) that cut a number of thin
QLP dikes, a relationship similar to that observed in the Cu-
Au orebody at higher elevations. Plagioclase is locally altered
to illite-smectite, as it is throughout much of the Bingham
stock.
Discussion and Conclusions
Through mapping and petrographic study we have defined
and characterized a sequence of structurally controlled por-
phyry intrusions, vein formation, and associated wall-rock al-
teration leading to Cu-Au-Mo ore formation. The observationspresented above lead to conclusions regarding both genetic
and exploration aspects of porphyry copper deposits. 
Structural controls of dikes, veins, and grade patterns
Ore-related porphyry dikes in the Bingham pit were em-
placed along steeply dipping, north-northeast–striking faults
of probable extensional origin (Presnell, 1998). This struc-
tural control is seen at the district scale where porphyry dikes
extend over distances of 6 to 10 km along the same north-
northeast trend (e.g., Lanier et al., 1978a). 
North-northeast–striking LP and QLP have northwest-
striking apophyses and thickened nodes at intersections of
north-northeast– and northwest-striking faults (Fig. 3). These
intersections also are marked by abundant quartz veins paral-
lel to these two fault sets, intense potassic alteration, and
high-grade Cu-Au mineralization in LP and QLP (Figs. 10,
11). We suggest that flow of magmatic-hydrothermal fluids
within successive porphyries was focused at these structural
intersections.
Vein attitudes in porphyry-type deposits are variable
through time, reflecting changing stress regimes imposed
both by the magmatic system and regional tectonic stresses
(e.g., Tosdal and Richards, 2001). Attitudes of ore-related
quartz veins yield information not only on stress fields and
fluid flow (Gruen et al., 2010) but also on structural control of
metal grades that can be applied in exploration, ore reserve
estimation, and mining. At El Salvador, Chile, A-veins are
randomly oriented, B-veins commonly have flat dips, and D-
veins show a radial pattern centered on the late porphyry
(Gustafson and Hunt, 1975). At Bajo de la Alumbrera, Ar-
gentina (Proffett, 2003), peripheral dikes define a radial pat-
tern centered on irregular stocks, but a weak north-northwest
trend could be either local or regional in origin. D-veins oc-
cupy both radial and concentric fractures. At the Endeavor
porphyry Cu-Au deposits, Australia (Heithersay and Walshe,
1995; Lickfold et al., 2003), early ore-bearing quartz veins oc-
cupy intrusion-centered fractures, whereas veins with hy-
drolytic alteration suggest that late fluid flow shifted to a far-
field stress regime. 
In contrast to the above examples, some porphyry deposits
have veins and intrusions that reflect mostly far-field stresses.
Ore-related A-veins with potassic alteration at the Yerington
mine, Nevada (Carten, 1986), occurred mostly in steep,
sheeted fractures parallel to the northwest strike of dike
swarms and zones of high-grade copper. At structurally
deeper levels within the cupola below the Yerington mine
orebody and in deep exposures at the nearby Ann-Mason Pass
deposit (Dilles and Einaudi, 1992), barren quartz-oligoclase
veins are preferentially oriented along the same regional
northwest trend. Bingham fits the category of deposits con-
trolled by regional structure, similar to the Yerington mine
and Ann-Mason Pass. 
One-phase low-salinity fluids and depth to magma source
Fluid inclusions in quartz veins from >500 m below the
high-grade orebody in QMP trapped a single-phase, CO 2-
rich, low-salinity magmatic fluid (Redmond, 2002; Redmond
et al., 2004, Landtwing et al., 2005, 2010). Similar fluid inclu-
sions have rarely been identified in porphyry systems (Roberts,
1973; John, 1989; Rusk et al., 2008) because the trapping of60 REDMOND AND EINAUDI
0361-0128/98/000/000-00 $6.00 60
such fluids takes place at depths not generally exposed and
sampled or because such fluid inclusions are present more
commonly in deposits with deep source regions. Depth to
source region may have a fundamental effect on the charac-
teristics of associated porphyry deposits (Proffett, 2009), in-
cluding vein types, early alteration styles, sulfide-oxide min-
eral assemblages, and temporal relations between porphyry
intrusions and ore-grade copper. Following Proffett’s (2009)
criteria, Bingham appears to have characteristics of both deep
and shallow source regions, suggesting an intermediate depth
to magmatic sources of fluids of about 5 km. If this is the case,
and given the paleodepth estimates of 2.0 km for the present
pit bottom (Redmond et al., 2004), then the source cupola
underlying Bingham was located at 3.0 km below the current
base of the pit.
Role of mafic magmas
BP , the third in a sequence of five porphyries mapped dur-
ing the current study, is relatively mafic in composition (App.
2, Table 1). BP contains 59 to 62 wt percent SiO 2, but it is
clearly not the same as the minette dike described by Keith et
al. (1998). The abundance of biotite (10–15%) and relatively
high chromium content (270–370 ppm), however, suggest an
affinity with primitive alkaline magmas. The occurrence of
this mineralized mafic dike within the sequence of porphyry
intrusions appears to further support the hypothesis that
mafic magmas interacted with latitic magmas in the parent
magma chamber below Bingham and contributed metals and
volatiles to the system (Keith et al., 1998). However, based on
our study, if mafic magmas contributed ore-forming compo-
nents, this contribution was only significant prior to and/or
during QMP time as the decline in grade of successive por-
phyries indicates a depletion of metals and volatiles in the
magma chamber through time. 
Multiple cycles of porphyry dike emplacement, 
vein formation, and sulfide deposition 
Mapped relationships between veins and porphyry intru-
sive contacts show that each porphyry emplacement event
was followed by a similar sequence of vein formation and
potassic alteration leading to copper-iron sulfide and gold de-
position (Fig. 12). All five porphyry intrusions contain zones
of abundant A-quartz veins, intense potassic alteration, and
high-grade copper-gold ore. However, QMP , the first and vol-
umetrically largest porphyry intrusion, hosts the bulk of the
high-grade copper-gold ore. Vein-dike relationships indicate
that this high-grade ore in QMP is not the product of multi-
ple episodes of overprinting or of continuous flux of ore-bear-
ing hydrothermal fluids, as has been suggested in a number of
other porphyry deposits such as the Yerington mine, Nevada
(Einaudi et al., unpub. data, 1969–1982; Proffett, 2009), and
the Henderson porphyry molybdenum deposit, Colorado
(Seedorff and Einaudi, 2004). At Bingham, we argue against
significant grade increases from overprinting on the basis of
the following: (1) lack of any symmetry in copper grades sur-
rounding dikes that postdate QMP , and (2) absence of a
mapped relation between >0.7 percent Cu and the location of
late dikes (Fig. 10).
We conclude that the flux of magmatic-hydrothermal fluids
and the mass of introduced copper and gold decreasedmarkedly through time as each successive porphyry intrusive-
hydrothermal cycle depleted the underlying parent magma
chamber of metals and volatiles. Similar patterns of declining
grade through successive porphyry intrusions are observed at
many but not all (Proffett, 2009) porphyry deposits, including
El Salvador, Chile (Gustafson and Hunt, 1975), Bajo de la
Alumbrera, Argentina (Proffett, 2003), Los Pelambres, Chile
(Atkinson et al., 1996), the Endeavor deposits, Australia (Hei-
thersay and Walshe, 1995; Lickfold et al., 2003), and Ccacalla,
Cotabambas, Peru (Perelló et al., 2004). The presence of late,
low-grade porphyry intrusions has a bearing on exploration
and mining, especially where these late intrusions are large
and emplaced in the center of the intrusive complex. At Bing-
ham, late porphyries, being narrow dikes, caused minimal di-
lution and do not present significant difficulties in mining.
Sequence of vein formation 
EDM veins predate A-quartz veins in numerous porphyry
deposits, including the type locality, Butte, Montana (Meyer,
1965), Los Pelambres (type 4 veins of Atkinson et al., 1996),
El Salvador (EB and C veins of Gustafson and Quiroga,
1995), and Ann-Mason Pass, Nevada (Proffett, 2009). Al-
though EDM halos at Bingham do not contribute signifi-
cantly to copper grades, in other deposits these veins repre-
sent a major early mineralization style. For example, at Butte,
Montanna (Brimhall, 1973, 1977), and in the Chuquicamata
district, Chile (Proffett, 2009), EDM halos constitute the
higher grade parts of the potassic-related ores.
A-quartz veins in QMP display a progression from irregular
wavy to straight-walled with time. This pattern is similar to
the changes in quartz vein characteristics described at other
porphyry deposits (e.g., Gustafson and Hunt, 1975) and is
consistent with the transition from plastic to brittle conditions
that occurs as rocks cool (Fournier, 1991, 1999). A-quartz
veins from the entire 1,500 m vertical interval examined have
K-feldspar halos and are similarly abundant within and below
the QMP copper-gold orebody. In contrast to early A-quartz
veins, A5 veinlets are far less abundant below the orebody, co-
incident with a reduction in copper-gold grades, potassic al-
teration intensity, and bornite/chalcopyrite ratios.
Quartz-molybdenite veins constitute the bulk of the molyb-
denum ore at Bingham, postdate the emplacement of the last
porphyry (QLP) and are in turn cut and offset by late quartz-
sericite-pyrite veins. A relatively late age for molybdenum
mineralization is supported by the Re-Os dating of Chesley
and Ruiz (1998). The late timing of molydenum deposition is
further supported by the lack of correlation between molyb-
denum and copper grades in the orebody. 
Space-time model of orebody formation
The temporal sequence of veins, wall-rock alteration, and
sulfides detailed above, combined with P-T data from fluid
inclusions studies (Redmond, 2002; Redmond et al., 2004;
Landtwing et al., 2005, 2010) allow us to illustrate the space-
time-temperature evolution veins and ore deposition in the
QMP-LP zone (Fig. 12).
Bornite-chalcopyrite-bearing EDM halos represent the
earliest sulfide-depositional event at Bingham. Similar veins
at Butte, Montana, formed between 650° and 550°C during
transient fluctuations between lithostatic and hydrostaticTHE BINGHAM CANYON PORPHYRY Cu-Mo-Au DEPOSIT: INTRUSIONS, VEIN FORMATION, & SULFIDE DEPOSITION 61

pressure at 6 km depth (Roberts, 1973, 1975; Brimhall, 1977;
Rusk, 2003; Rusk et al., 2008). Although we conducted no
fluid inclusion studies on EDM veins, temperatures of ~550°–
500°C are required by the K-feldspar-andalusite-muscovite
assemblage at near-lithostatic pressure at the 2 km paleodepth
estimated for Bingham (Hemley and Hunt, 1992). EDM halos
provide the strongest evidence in porphyry copper deposits
for copper deposition at temperatures >500°C. Furthermore,
during each period of EDM formation, no A-quartz veins
formed (Fig. 12). Therefore, A-quartz veins and major sulfide
deposition represent episodic pulses of hydrothermal fluid fol-
lowing each intrusion, rather than representing a continuousflux of hydrothermal fluids, at declining intensity, throughout
the period of multiple porphyry intrusions.
Redmond et al. (2004) showed that, following the forma-
tion of EDM veins, an ascending, single-phase magmatic fluid
formed barren quartz veins at depth prior to phase separation
(Fig. 12). Phase separation to coexisting brine and vapor took
place approx. 500 m below the base of the high-grade ore-
body of the QMP-LP zone at 550° to 500°C and ~625 bars
pressure (Redmond et al., 2004; Landtwing et al., 2005, 2010).
Brine and vapor continued to ascend and cool, due to expan-
sion and heat loss to the wall rocks, forming A1-A4 quartz
veins and associated potassic alteration.62 REDMOND AND EINAUDI

FIG. 12.  Time-space-temperature diagram showing evolution of vein types, alteration, and high-grade copper and molyb-
denum ore based on time lines provided by individual porphyry intrusions. The depth axis is located in center of the QMP-
LP zone and relationships shown are based on mapping and core-logging within the depth window of 1.8 to 3.3 km pale-
odepths. Temperature contours (dashed black lines) and upper boundary of one-phase fluids (blue bars) are based on fluid
inclusion studies of Redmond (2002) and Redmond et al. (2004). Time-space distribution of sericitic alteration at paleo -
depths of <1.5 km is speculative, and this region may have contained silicic and advanced argillic alteration. Abbreviations:
bn = bornite, cp = chalcopyrite, moly = molybdenite, QSP = quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration.
Fluid inclusion data indicate that lithostatic to hydrostatic
decompression occurred during A-quartz vein formation as
temperatures declined to about 425°C (Redmond, 2002). The
inferred temperature range is in good agreement with rock
mechanics data and observations from active geothermal sys-
tems (Fournier, 1991, 1999). The numerous unconformities
between CL growth zones in A1 to A4 quartz (Fig. 7) indicate
that multiple cycles of quartz precipitation-dissolution-pre-
cipitation occurred as a result of pressure fluctuations or cool-
ing in the P-T region of retrograde quartz solubility
(Fournier, 1999). Depressurization from lithostatic to hydro-
static pressure conditions causes the muscovite-K-feldspar
phase boundary to move toward lower (m KCl + K+/mHCl + H+)
values at any given temperature (Hemley and Hunt, 1992)
and would allow hydrothermal fluids to cool even further
while remaining in the K-feldspar stability field.
Formation of A5 quartz veins and associated Cu-Au miner-
alization occured within the K-feldspar stability field as tem-
peratures declined from 425° to 350°C at hydrostatic pres-
sure (Redmond, 2002; Redmond et al., 2004; Landtwing et
al., 2005, 2010). We interpret this thermal decline to be the
driving force for Cu-Fe sulfide deposition, given the lack of
evidence of mixing of hydrothermal fluids with low-salinity
waters, the lack of correspondence of the ore zone with the
initiation of phase separation, and no change in wall-rock al-
teration style. This conclusion is strongly supported by laser
ablation ICP-MS analyses which show that copper concentra-
tions in fluid inclusions in A5 veinlets drop by two orders of
magnitude, within a narrow pressure-temperature interval
between 210 and 140 bar and 425° to 350°C (Landtwing et
al., 2005). The sharp base to the QMP-LP zone orebody at
~1,500 m elevation (500 m above the zone of phase separa-
tion) may represent the location of the 425°C isotherm at the
time of ore formation in the QMP-LP zone.
This study provides new evidence and new lines of inquiry
regarding the formation of Bingham, and, by analogy, other
giant porphyry copper deposits. The inception of extensional
faulting may have triggered the emplacement of porphyry
magma, but the fact that extension was minor ensured that
these magmas and accompanying volatiles did not vent.
Structural intersections may have been particularly effective
in localizing zones of high-grade copper-gold ore. Intramin-
eral mafic dikes suggest an open-system magma chamber at
depth that was replenished through time with ore-forming
components, although this may not have been a key factor in
generating the large Bingham deposit, given that the bulk of
the ore was introduced with the first porphyry intrusion. Fi-
nally, EDM halos, a vein type not generally recognized in por-
phyry deposits, represent a process, at present poorly under-
stood, that led to early, high-temperature deposition of Cu
and Au. These early halos formed a low-grade protore that
may have subsequently contributed copper and gold during
formation of younger A-quartz veins which host the bulk of
the copper-gold ore.

Notes: Assays by Intertek Testing Services (Bondar Clegg Inc.); copper, silver, and molybdenum were analyzed by standard multi- acid (HF-HNO 3-HClO 4-
HCl) digestion followed by induced coupled plasma (ICP) analysis; gold analysis was carried out by standard fire assay–AA technique; sample size varied from
0.5 to 6 kg; all sample numbers above prefixed with either 4890-, 4990-, 5090-, or 5190- were collected in the open pit by Redmond during the summer of
1998 and 1999; these numbers refer to the bench elevation (in ft) on which they were collected (see Fig. 4); the second part of the sample no. refers to the
horizontal distance in feet from a reference point on each bench; the reference point on each bench was an electricity pole arbitrarily designated as 1,500
feet (increasing to the northeast along each bench); this line of poles is shown on the location map above; for example, sample 5090-1524 was collected 24
feet to the northeast of the pole on bench 5090
