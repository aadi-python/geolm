The Bingham Canyon porphyry Cu-Mo-Au deposit is a large and complex geological system characterized by multiple porphyry intrusions, vein formation, and associated wall-rock alteration. The deposit is centered on a late Eocene composite pluton, the Bingham stock, which intruded a thick sequence of quartzite, calcareous quartzite, and limestone of the Pennsylvanian Oquirrh Group. The Bingham stock is made up of an equigranular monzonite phase that was intruded by a series of ore-related porphyry dikes, including quartz monzonite porphyry (QMP), latite porphyry (LP), biotite porphyry (BP), quartz latite porphyry breccia (QLPbx), and quartz latite porphyry (QLP). The porphyry intrusions are steeply dipping and have two dominant orientations: north-northeast and northwest-striking. The north-northeast faults served as conduits for ore-forming fluids peripheral to the Bingham stock. The porphyry dikes, faults, and quartz veins are steeply dipping and have two dominant orientations; north-northeast and northwest-striking. Each porphyry intrusion was accompanied by a similar sequence of veins, potassic alteration, and sulfides. The vein types include biotite veinlets, early dark micaceous (EDM) veins, A-quartz veins, quartz-molybdenite veins, and quartz-sericite-pyrite veins. The intensity of potassic alteration is highest in QMP and declines with time through the succession of intrusions. Copper and gold grades are highest in QMP and decline abruptly across contacts from older to younger porphyries. The bornite/chalcopyrite ratio also varies between porphyry intrusions, with the highest ratios found in QMP. The deposit formed through multiple cycles of porphyry dike emplacement, vein formation, and sulfide deposition, with a general decline in copper-gold grade through time. The magmatic-hydrothermal fluids underwent a similar physiochemical evolution during and immediately following emplacement of each porphyry dike. The copper-gold ore is associated with potassic alteration and A-quartz veins, which are most abundant in QMP. The Bingham Canyon deposit is characterized by a complex geological history, with multiple stages of magmatic and hydrothermal activity. The deposit's formation is linked to the emplacement of porphyry dikes and the associated release of magmatic-hydrothermal fluids.
