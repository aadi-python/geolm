The Bingham Canyon porphyry Cu-Mo-Au deposit is a large, high-grade porphyry orebody hosted in a late Eocene composite pluton, the Bingham stock, which intruded a thick sequence of quartzite, calcareous quartzite, and limestone of the Pennsylvanian Oquirrh Group. The Bingham stock is composed of an equigranular monzonite phase intruded by a series of ore-related porphyry dikes, including quartz monzonite porphyry (QMP), latite porphyry (LP), biotite porphyry (BP), quartz latite porphyry breccia (QLPbx), and quartz latite porphyry (QLP). The porphyry dikes are steeply dipping and have two dominant orientations: north-northeast and northwest-striking. The north-northeast faults served as conduits for ore-forming fluids peripheral to the Bingham stock. The QMP-LP zone is characterized by a sequence of veins that formed after the intrusion of each porphyry, including biotite veinlets, early dark micaceous (EDM) veins, A-quartz veins, quartz-molybdenite veins, and quartz-sericite-pyrite veins. The A-quartz veins are the most abundant vein type and contain copper-iron sulfides and gold. The intensity of potassic alteration is a function of A-quartz vein abundance, and zones of intense quartz-K-feldspar alteration are found where A-quartz veins constitute â‰¥10 vol percent of the rock. Copper and gold grades are highest in QMP and decline abruptly across contacts with younger porphyries. The bornite/chalcopyrite ratio also varies between porphyry intrusions, with the highest ratios found in QMP. The abrupt decline in copper-gold grades below approximately 1,500 m elevation in all five porphyry intrusions is coincident with a reduction in A5 veinlets and intensity of potassic alteration. The Bingham Canyon deposit formed through multiple cycles of porphyry dike emplacement, vein formation, and sulfide deposition, with the flux of magmatic-hydrothermal fluids and the mass of introduced copper and gold decreasing markedly through time as each successive porphyry intrusive-hydrothermal cycle depleted the underlying parent magma chamber of metals and volatiles.
