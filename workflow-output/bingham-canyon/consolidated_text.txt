The Bingham Canyon porphyry Cu-Mo-Au deposit is a large, high-grade porphyry orebody located in the Oquirrh Mountains of Utah. The deposit is centered on a late Eocene composite pluton, referred to as the Bingham stock, which intruded a thick sequence of quartzite, calcareous quartzite, and limestone of the Pennsylvanian Oquirrh Group. The Bingham stock is made up of an equigranular monzonite phase that was intruded by a series of ore-related porphyry dikes, including quartz monzonite porphyry (QMP), latite porphyry (LP), biotite porphyry (BP), quartz latite porphyry breccia (QLPbx), and quartz latite porphyry (QLP). The porphyry dikes are steeply dipping and have two dominant orientations: north-northeast and northwest-striking. The north-northeast faults served as conduits for ore-forming fluids peripheral to the Bingham stock. The porphyry dikes are characterized by a similar sequence of veins, potassic alteration, and sulfides, which decline in intensity with time. The earliest vein type is biotite veinlets, followed by early dark micaceous (EDM) veins, and then A-quartz veins. A-quartz veins are the most abundant vein type and contain Cu-Fe sulfides and gold. The intensity of potassic alteration is highest in QMP and decreases with time through the succession of intrusions. Copper and gold grades are highest in QMP and decline abruptly across contacts from older to younger porphyries. The bornite/chalcopyrite ratio also declines with time through the succession of intrusions. The deposit formed through multiple cycles of porphyry dike emplacement, vein formation, and sulfide deposition, with the flux of magmatic-hydrothermal fluids and the mass of introduced copper and gold decreasing markedly through time. The observations presented lead to conclusions regarding both genetic and exploration aspects of porphyry copper deposits, including the role of structural controls, the depth to magma source, and the role of mafic magmas. The Bingham Canyon deposit is characterized by a complex geological history, with multiple stages of magmatic and hydrothermal activity, and provides valuable insights into the formation of giant porphyry copper deposits. The deposit's geological setting, igneous rocks, and structural controls are all important factors in understanding its formation and evolution.
