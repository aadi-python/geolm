The Bingham Canyon porphyry Cu-Mo-Au deposit is a large and complex geological system characterized by multiple porphyry intrusions, vein formation, and associated wall-rock alteration. The deposit is centered on a late Eocene composite pluton, known as the Bingham stock, which intruded a thick sequence of quartzite, calcareous quartzite, and limestone of the Pennsylvanian Oquirrh Group. The Bingham stock is composed of an equigranular monzonite phase that was intruded by a series of ore-related porphyry dikes, including quartz monzonite porphyry (QMP), latite porphyry (LP), biotite porphyry (BP), quartz latite porphyry breccia (QLPbx), and quartz latite porphyry (QLP). The porphyry intrusions are steeply dipping and have two dominant orientations: north-northeast and northwest-striking. The north-northeast faults served as conduits for ore-forming fluids peripheral to the Bingham stock. The QMP is the earliest and volumetrically largest porphyry intrusion and contains the highest copper and gold grades. The sequence of porphyries is accompanied by a similar sequence of veins, potassic alteration, and sulfides, but at declining intensity. The main vein types are biotite veinlets, early dark micaceous (EDM) veins, A-quartz veins, quartz-molybdenite veins, and quartz-sericite-pyrite veins. The A-quartz veins are the most abundant and contain the bulk of the copper-gold ore. The intensity of potassic alteration is highest in QMP and declines with time through the succession of intrusions. Copper and gold grades also decline with time, with abrupt grade changes occurring at porphyry contacts. The structural intersections between north-northeast-striking porphyry dikes and northwest-striking faults focused hydrothermal fluid flow and mark the location of individual high-grade copper-gold zones in successive porphyry intrusions. The Bingham Canyon deposit formed through multiple cycles of porphyry dike emplacement, vein formation, and sulfide deposition, with a general decline in copper-gold grade through time. The deposit's formation is linked to the emplacement of porphyry magmas and the release of magmatic-hydrothermal fluids, which underwent a similar physiochemical evolution during and immediately following emplacement of each porphyry dike. The copper-gold ore was deposited at temperatures between 425° and 350°C, within the K-feldspar stability field, and at hydrostatic pressure. The Bingham Canyon porphyry Cu-Mo-Au deposit is a complex geological system that provides valuable insights into the formation of giant porphyry copper deposits. The deposit's characteristics, including its structural controls, vein types, and alteration styles, are consistent with a deep to intermediate depth of formation, and its magmatic-hydrothermal fluids were likely derived from a magma chamber at depth. The deposit's copper-gold ore was deposited through a combination of magmatic-hydrothermal fluid flow and structural controls, resulting in a large and complex orebody.
