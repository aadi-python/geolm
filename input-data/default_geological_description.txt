The Bingham Canyon deposit sits in a thick sequence of Pennsylvanian to Permian sedimentary rocks (limestones, shales, and sandstones) overlying Precambrian metamorphic basement (gneiss and schist). During the Eocene–Oligocene (~36–32 Ma), multiple pulses of quartz monzonite to quartz diorite porphyry intruded along the southwest-northeast trending Bingham shear zone, forming a central stock and radial dikes.

Hydrothermal alteration and copper-gold-molybdenum mineralization occurred primarily between 34 and 30 Ma, with potassic core and outer phyllic halos. A major erosional unconformity removed part of the roof, then was followed by deposition of Miocene conglomerates. Late Miocene to Pliocene normal faulting along the Oquirrh fault system locally offset the porphyry and sedimentary units, exhuming the deposit to near surface.
